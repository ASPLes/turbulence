                        BEEP serverName feature

   that allows to request serverName value at session initialization.

BEEP serverName feature  BEEP serverName feature            October 2009


1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Motivation

   BEEP allows to define the serverName under which a connection/session
   will act.  This provides fundamental administrative features for
   virtual servers (like provisioning particular values according to
   such serverName value).

   As defined in "2.3.1.2 The Start Message" (inside [RFC3080]),
   serverName value is establish on the first successful channel opened
   requesting such value, causing the connection/session to be bound to
   such value.  Next channels opened requesting other serverName values
   are ignored.

   The serverName feature presented (for now x-serverName feature) is
   defined to allow a connecting BEEP peer to signal serverName value at
   the beginning of the session/connection, without waiting the first
   channel to be opened.

   The intention is to provide an easy mechanism for BEEP listeners to
   decide providing services according to requested serverName, without
   waiting to channel start requests.

   The mechanism is entirely optional due to BEEP features nature, but
   when available, will provide a clear path to provide services for
   only a set of serverNames available.


3.  Requesting a BEEP session with serverName

   Taking as reference section 2.4 "Session Establishment and Release"
   from [RFC3080], a session is opened as usual, but requesting on
   greetings feature the serverName desired value.  Here is an example:

          L: <wait for incoming connection>
          I: <open connection>
          L: RPY 0 0 . 0 110
          L: Content-Type: application/beep+xml
          L:
          L: <greeting>
          L:    <profile uri='http://iana.org/beep/TLS' />
          L: </greeting>
          L: END
          I: RPY 0 0 . 0 89
          I: Content-Type: application/beep+xml
          I:
          I: <greeting features='x-serverName=beep.aspl.es' />
          I: END

   NOTE: Since x-serverName is still a proposed feature, it is required
   to signal it using "x-" prefix.  BEEP peers must support both
   versions (serverName and x-serverName).

   As showed in previous example, an initiator BEEP peer request the
   establishment of a BEEP session acting under the domain of
   beep.aspl.es using greetings feature x-serverName.

   In the case a BEEP listener peer decides to not provide services
   under the provided domain, it MAY close the connection (and should
   log a diagnostic error).


4.  serverName Feature Registration

   Feature Identification: x-serverName .
