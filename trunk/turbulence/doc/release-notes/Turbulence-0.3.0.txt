Release note
~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Advanced Software Production Line is proud to announce the
  Turbulence 0.3.0 "Like in the movies" release: an open source BEEP
  general application server, written on top of Vortex Library.

  Turbulence is a BEEP server extensible through modules and allows to
  implement server side profiles that are used and combined later with
  other profiles through run time configuration.

  Turbulence is written to make it easy to develop and deploy BEEP
  profiles, allowing developers to provide a convenient configuration
  interface to site administrators and end users.

The release in short
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Next major release for Turbulence including lot of new features and
  bug fixes, mostly located at the Turbulence core and the
  mod-sasl. Added initial implementation for the turbulence
  regression.

  Now the mod-sasl allows virtual hosting configuration: this allows
  to configure auth-db associated to particular serverName
  configurations. Along with this, the mod-sasl is shipped with a new
  XML-RPC remote administration interface (SASL-RADMIN) which allows
  third party applications to perform SASL administrative tasks in all
  domains. A security update allows mod-sasl to store password
  hashed with md5 and sha-1.

  At the Turbulence core, an initial connection manager implementation
  has been added, including a function to broadcast a message over all
  connections having a particular profile. Now Turbulence allows to
  configure the maximum number of channels running a profile per
  connection.

  None.

Changes since the 0.2.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

turbulence:

* [new] Updated turbulence db list module to include a new removal
  function which delete items according to an external handler. API
  added:

  - turbulence_db_list_remove_by_func
  - TurbulenceDbListRemoveFunc (handler)

  Updated regression tests to check this.

* [fix] Removed turbulence_db_list_status function. It is an api
  duplicated on turbulence_db_list_get.

* [fix] Making features configuration to be optional at the config
  DTD.

* [fix] Added initial code to support the "x-client-close" feature.
  Pending to check its real effect.

* [new] Added new module to control all connections created under the
  context of the turbulence server. Added initial code to provide
  broadcasting services over all connections, that have a selected
  profile. Public API added:

  - turbulence_conn_mgr_broadcast_msg
  - TurbulenceConnMgrFilter (handler)

* [new] Updated turbulence engine to allow configuring the maximum
  number of channels that can be running a particular profile, inside
  the profile path configuration. Updated documentation to include
  some references.

* [fix] Making turbulence exit/signal handling to terminate turbulence
  modules just after vortex termination to avoid unmapping memory
  regions that contains handlers configured inside vortex library.

* [fix] Making turbulence runtime and turbulence module to better
  reach to modules that wan't loaded properly (undefined symbol).

* [fix] Fixed bug inside the common sasl module, while changing auth
  passwords..

* [fix] Added missing index to the db list documentation.

* [fix] Updated documentation to include some references to the
  tbc-dblist-mgr usage and the new support provided by mod-sasl for

  mod-sasl to enable/disabled and check status for remote
  administration support.

* [fix] Fixed bug inside turbulence_db_list_close and
  turbulence_db_list_cleanup which was causing double deallocation
  operation under different situations but especially for those db
  list opened but not closed manually. Updated regression test to
  check both situations (manually and automatic close).

* [new] Added initial code to implement all operations required to
  operate sasl users inside the xml-rpc sasl remote admin.

* [fix] Fixed common sasl validation function to also check that the
  auth_id is inside the remote admins list.

* [fix] Updated autoconf files to include new pkg-config file to
  export sasl-radmin.idl file.

* [fix] Configured mod-sasl source code to install a pkg-config file
  to allow locating IDL file used to implement the client side of the
  remote administration interface.

* [fix] Implemented initial version for the get_users service for the
  SASL remote administration.

* [fix] Fixed validation service provided by the common sasl module to
  only accept services under the sasl-radmin resource.

* [fix] Started and committing initial files for the remote SASL
  administration.  Added initial implementation for the resource
  validation function. Added initial implementation for the get_users
  service.

* [fix] Updated turbulence module internals to secure the list of
  modules loaded with a mutex.

* [new] Updated regression test to check turbulence module loading
  code.  Updated the turbulence module API to include a function to
  unregister a module from the list of modules loaded.

* [fix] Updated regression test to check sasl support for several auth-db
  associated to different server names.

* [new] Added a new function to the sasl module to check if a
  particular auth Id is disabled. Updated regression test to check
  this. API added:

   - common_sasl_user_is_disabled

* [fix] More progress on regression test. Updated
  common_sasl_user_disable to allow enabling/disabling a particular
  user rather only allowing to disable.

* [fix] making progress on general regression test and fixing bugs
  exposed. Updated common_sasl_user_exists and user database loading
  related functions.

* [new] Added new function to the support module to check in a
  portable way the base dir and the file name for a provided
  path. Updated regression test to check this. API added:

   - turbulence_base_dir
   - turbulence_file_name

  passwords with other formats than clear text. Now it is also
  supported md5 and sha-1. Updated tools and authentication code. This
