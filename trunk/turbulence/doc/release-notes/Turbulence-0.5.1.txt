Release note
~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Advanced Software Production Line is proud to announce Turbulence
  0.5.1 "Profile jump" release: an open source BEEP application
  server, written on top of Vortex Library 1.1.

  Turbulence is a BEEP server extensible through modules which allows
  to implement server side profiles that are used and combined later
  with other profiles through run time configuration.

  Turbulence is written to make it easy to develop and deploy BEEP
  profiles, allowing developers to provide a convenient configuration
  interface to site administrators and end users.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  

  Many bugs were fixed and many regression tests were added. Added lot
  of documentation.


Change notifications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  None.

Changes since the 0.4.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* [new] Updated tbc-sasl-conf tool to allow loading databases from
  different locations than default. This allows users to implement
  SASL databases inside they working directories.

* [new] Updated tbc-sasl-conf tool to allow changing passwords to
  existing users.

* [fix] Fixed log creation with wrong permissions.

* [fix] Making configure process to create directory used to transfer
  socket connections between process and to set the right permissions
  (/var/lib/turbulence).

* [fix] Updated clean start code to detect if the server was started
  or not, to avoid killing the server when it was working.

* [fix] Adding some checks to turbulence_msg, error, wrn and error to
  avoid printing NULL values. Updated mod-python module to also check
  values received from Python space (especially None).

* [fix] Updating mod-python to sanitize strings received on
  tbc.{msg,error} API avoiding passing uncomplete %s format to C API.

* [fix] Updating mod-python turbulence.Ctx.msg/error/wrn method to
  replace all % by # to avoid printf functions inside C API to handle
  such characters..

* [new] Updated mod-python to allow administrator to define python
  paths that will be included before loading a python app.  XML path:
  <mod-python/application/location/add-path>

* [fix] Updated mod-python location support to allow keeping the path
  defined to load the python start file after module was completely
  loaded.

* [fix] Updated python.conf.xml example to include add-path
  references.

* [fix] Committing init script.

* [new] Added new fully working mod-tls to support TLS profile inside
  turbulence. The module allows to configure a set of certificates to
  be used according to serverNames provided by connecting peer. Added
  initial module documentation.

* [fix] Making mod-sasl to not return a critical error on profile path
  selected in the case no database is found associated to the
  serverName provided.

* [fix] Improved profile path filtering code to gather information
  from turbulence connection manager module to search and apply
  restrictions instead of checking all profiles registered
  globally. For example, now all operations are done against opened
  profiles on a connection (not channels) which improve operations
  where 1000 channels may be opened but only 3 profiles are running.

* [fix] Updated turbulence profile path module to allow application
  layer to install a profile alias that causes to check a certain
  attribute on a connection instead of the profile itself. This is
  useful for TLS profile because once it finishes, there is no TLS
  channel to check.  API added:

   - turbulence_ppath_add_profile_attr_alias

* [new] Updated turbulence expressions module to also record the
  expression that was used to build the object. Now it is possible to
  check this string by using:

   - turbulence_expr_get_expression

* [new] Updated turbulence documentation to explain how to use and
  configure system paths.

* [fix] Updated turbulence process module to check if exists the run
  time directory used to create the child control socket. The module
  creates it in the case it is not available.

* [new] Added new function that allows getting profile stats on a
  particular connection. API added:

   - turbulence_conn_mgr_profiles_stats

* [new] Updated regression test to check new mod-tls added. Added
  additional checks to ensure the module properly interacts with other
  modules, especially mod-sasl (test 22).

* [fix] Updated mod-tls documentation to include examples to create a
  key and a certificate.

* [fix] Adding documentation to explain how to include additional
  paths to mod-python loaded applications.

* [fix] Updating error reporting at mod-tls.

* [fix] Fixed documentation building warning to avoid using
  gnu-extensions.
