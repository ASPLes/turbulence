/** 
 * \page turbulence_mod_sasl mod-sasl: SASL support for Turbulence
 *
 * \section turbulence_mod_sasl_intro Introduction
 *
 * <b>mod-sasl</b> module provides user authentication to Turbulence. Inside
 * BEEP, the SASL protocol is used by default to provide user
 * authentication.
 *
 * \section turbulence_mod_sasl_configuration Base configuration
 *
 * <b>mod-sasl</b> is a module that provides SASL support for turbulence. It
 * includes facilities to configure which SASL profiles can be enabled
 * and the users database to be used.
 *
 * This module is included in the Turbulence official distribution. To
 * enable it you must make it available at some of the directories
 * that are used by Turbulence to load modules (see \ref
 * turbulence_modules_configuration). Under most cases this is done as
 * follows:
 *
 * \code
 *   >> cd /etc/turbulence/mod-enabled
 *   >> ln -s ../mod-available/mod-sasl.xml
 * \endcode
 *
 *
 * Once included the module you must restart Turbulence. Now the
 * <b>mod-sasl</b> is activated you must configure it. This is done by
 * updating <b>sasl.conf</b> file which is usually located at
 * <b>/etc/turbulence/sasl/sasl.conf</b>. Here is an example:
 * 
 * \htmlinclude sasl.example.conf.tmp
 *
 * Previous configuration file example states that there is a default
 * authentication database (no <b>serverName</b> configured), using the md5
 * format to store passwords (<b>format</b>), storing such user and password
 * using the default xml backend provided by turbulence (<b>type</b>), which
 * is located at the file provided (<b>location</b>).
 *
 * The two remaining parameters (<b>remote-admins</b> and <b>remote</b>) allows to
 * configure the remote <b>mod-sasl</b> xml-rpc based administration
 * interface and to configure the set of allowed users that could use
 * this interface. See later for more details.
 *
 * The rest of the file configures the allowed SASL profiles to be
 * used by remote peers. Currently we only support plain.  Virtual
 * host configuration for SASL module
 *
 * Previous example shows how to configure the default backend used
 * for all <b>serverName</b> configurations. Inside BEEP, once a channel is
 * created, it is allowed to configure the <b>serverName</b> parameter asking
 * the server to act using such role. This value can be used to select
 * the proper auth backend configuration.
 *
 * How the <b>mod-sasl</b> selects the proper auth-db is done as follows:
 *
 * <ol>
 *
 *  <li>If the SASL request is being received in a connection which
 *  has the <b>serverName</b> parameter configured (either due to a previous
 *  channel created or due to the current SASL channel exchange), then
 *  it is searched a <b><auth-db></b> node with matches the <b>serverName</b>
 *  parameter.</li>
 *
 *  <li>If no match is found in the previous search, it is used the
 *  first <b><auth-db></b> node found without the <b>serverName</b>
 *  attribute configured. That is, the <b><auth-db></b> node
 *  configured without <b>serverName</b> is used as fallback default
 *  auth-db for all auth operations.</li>
 *
 * </ol>
 *
 * \section turbulence_mod_sasl_cli Command line interface to the mod-sasl: tbc-sasl-conf
 *
 * If you have a shell account into the turbulence machine, you can
 * use the <b>tbc-sasl-conf</b> tool to update users database (<b>auth-db.xml</b>),
 * rather than editing directly. You can add a user using the
 * following:
 *
 * \code
 *   >> tbc-sasl-conf --add-user beep-test
 *   I: adding user: beep-test..
 *   Password:
 *   Type again:
 *   I: user beep-test added!
 * \endcode
 *
 *
 * You can use the --serverName option to select the auth-db to be
 * used by the tool.
 *
 * \code
 *   >> tbc-sasl-conf --add-user beep-test --serverName beep.aspl.es
 *   I: adding user: beep-test..
 *   Password:
 *   Type again:
 *   I: user beep-test added!
 * \endcode
 *
 * Use <b>tbc-sasl-conf --help</b> to get full help.
 *
 * \section turbulence_mod_sasl_ramdin SASL-RADMIN: xml-rpc interface to manage SASL databases
 *
 * Starting from Turbulence 0.3.0, it is included a xml-rpc interface
 * that allows full management for all sasl databases installed. This
 * interface is mainly provided as a way to integrate into third party
 * applications the possibility to manage users, passwords, etc for
 * applications developed.
 * 
 * The following are a minimal set of instructions that will serve you
 * as starting point to integrate and use SASL-RADMIN.
 *
 * <ol>
 *
 *   <li>First you must locate the idl interface installed in your
 *   system. This is the sasl-radmin.idl file. On systems where
 *   pkg-config is available you can find it by using the following:
 *
 * \code
 *   >> pkg-config --cflags sasl-radmin
 *   /usr/share/mod-sasl/radmin/sasl-radmin.idl
 * \endcode
 *
 *  </li>
 *
 *  <li>This idl file includes not only the interface definition but
 *  also the code for all services provided. To build the C client
 *  interface, so you can perform XML-RPC invocations, you can do:
 *
 * \code
 *  >> xml-rpc-gen --out-stub-dir . --only-client --disable-main-file
 *                 --disable-autoconf /usr/share/mod-sasl/radmin/sasl-radmin.idl
 * \encode
 *
 * In the case your system has pkg-config, you can do the following:
 *
 * \code
 *  >> xml-rpc-gen --out-stub-dir . --only-client --disable-main-file
 *                   --disable-autoconf `pkg-config --cflags sasl-radmin`
 *  [ ok ] compiling: /usr/share/mod-sasl/radmin/sasl-radmin.idl..
 *  [ ok ] detected IDL format definition..
 *  [ ok ] detected xml-rpc definition: 'sasl-radmin'..
 *  [ ok ] found enforced resource: sasl-radmin

 *  [ ok ] server stub have been disabled..
 *  [ ok ] compilation ok
 * \endcode
 *
 * Don't mind about EE messages about missing files. Those ones are
 * used by the server side component, which is not your case. Along
 * with the output, the command list the set of files installed.
 * </li>
 *
 * <li>This will build a set of files that must be integrated into
 * your client application according to your building tools. For
 * autoconf users just include that files into your <b>"product_SOURCES"</b>
 * directive. See Vortex xml-rpc-gen tool documentation for more
 * information for an initial explanation.</li>
 * 
 * <li>As a last step, you must activate the remote administration on
 * each domain that will be allowed to do so. This done by using the
 * <b>remote</b> and <b>remote-admins</b> attributes. The first one must be set to
 * <b>"yes"</b>. The second must point to a db-list having a list of allowed
 * SASL administrators. See \ref turbulence_db_list_management to setup the
 * administrator list.</li>
 * </ol>
