    <!-- db users:

         type: allows to configure the kind of format that is
            expected to be found while reading the attribute location.

         location: allows to configure the location of the auth
            database. It can use relative paths, starting from the location
            of the current file.

         serverName: essential configuration item. Atention required. This 
            attribute allows to configure the SASL database to be used according
            to the serverName. This serverName is a fundamental attribute configured
            at the BEEP session. 
            This attribute is mainly used to configure different SASL users databases
            with different capabilities (the most notable, remote administration).
            It is only allowed one default SASL database, that is, an <auth-db>
            configuration without serverName.
        
         format: allows to configure the format used to store and retreive 
            keys stored. By default, if nothing is configured md5 is used.
            Allowed values are: plain, md5 and sha-1 (in security order).
            It is recomended to either use md5 or sha-1.

         remote: allows to configure the remote module configuration for 
            that particular entry. If no value is provided, by default is
            to disable remote administration. See module documentation to
            know more about remote administration.
  
         remote-admins: this attribute allows to configure a list
            of users that are allowed to use the remote administration 
            protocol. If this attribute is not defined all users will be
            allowed to admin the users database.
