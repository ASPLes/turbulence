    <!-- db users:

         type: allows to configure the kind of format that is expected
            to be found while reading the attribute location.

         location: allows to configure the location of the auth
            database. It can use relative paths, starting from the
            location of the current file.

         serverName: essential configuration item. Atention
            required. This attribute allows to configure the SASL
            database to be used according to the serverName. This
            serverName is a fundamental attribute configured at the
            BEEP session.

            This attribute is mainly used to configure different SASL
            users databases with different capabilities (the most
            notable, remote administration).  It is only allowed one
            default SASL database, that is, an <auth-db> configuration
            without serverName.
             
            From an administrative perspective, serverName is used to
            provide virtual hosting configuration.
        
         format: allows to configure the format used to store and
            retreive keys stored. By default, if nothing is configured
            md5 is used.  Allowed values are: plain, md5 and sha-1 (in
            security order).  It is recomended to either use md5 or
            sha-1.

         remote: allows to configure the remote module configuration
            for that particular entry. If no value is provided, by
            default is to disable remote administration. See module
            documentation to know more about remote administration.
  
         remote-admins: this attribute allows to configure a list of
            users that are allowed to use the remote administration
            protocol. If this attribute is not defined all users will
            be allowed to admin the users database.
