/** 
 * @brief Public definition for the init function that must implement
 * a turbulence module.
 *
 * The module must return axl_true to signal the modules was
 * properly initialized so turbulence can register it as usable.
 *
 * This handler is called only once at turbulence startup and when a
 * child process is created (separate="yes" directive inside profile
 * path configuration, see \ref turbulence_execution_model and \ref profile_path_configuration). 
 *
 * To know if current init call is for a child process you can use:
 *
 * \code
 * if (turbulence_ctx_is_child (ctx) {
 *      // reinitialize 
 * } else {
 *      // normal init
 * }
 * \endcode
 *
 * Keep in mind child creation is implemented using fork() call
 * (without further exec()). This means you may require reinitialize
 * some structures (like mutex). 
 *
 * @param ctx The turbulence context where the init operation is
 * taking place.
 * 
 * @return axl_true if the module is usable or axl_false if
 * not. Returning axl_false caused the module to be not loaded.

/** 
 * @brief Allows to notify the module that a profile path was selected
 * for a connection.
 *
 * The ppath_selected function is used by turbulence to signal modules
 * that a connection was finally configured under the provided profile
 * path. This is important because a profile path defines how the
 * connection will be limited and configured to accept profiles,
 * configuring process permission and so on.
 *
 * It is also useful because at the time a profile path is selected,
 * serverName name is available, allowing the module to take especial
 * actions.
 *
 * This module function is called just after a profile path is
 * selected for a connection, on first channel request received,
 * (according to serverName, src connection, etc). In the case the
 * profile path request a child process to handle the connection, the
 * module function is called after creating the child process and
 * after the child process implements optional chroot and optional
 * user:group change.
 *
 * In the case the profile path do not request to create a child
 * process, the handler is called on first channel request received on
 * a connection.
 *
 * Note that, unlike \ref ModInitFunc "init", this method is called
 * for each connection received for which a profile path is selected. 
 *
 * <b>Security: Important note about serverName</b>
 *
 * When a profile path is selected it is done according to preliminary
 * data provided by remote peer. In this context the module programmer
 * must see the serverName as a requested value but still not the
 * final serverName accepted. 
 *
 * The serverName will only be definitive only if all profile path
 * handlers accept it and a channel with that serverName is created.
 *
 * In this context, to get the serverName requested by remote peer you can use:
 * \code
 * serverName = turbulence_ppath_get_server_name (conn);
 * \endcode
 *
 *
 *
 * @param ctx The turbulence context where the profile path is being
 * selected.
 *
 * @param ppath_selected The profile path selected. Reference to the
 * object representing the profile path selected. See \ref
 * turbulence_ppath.
 *
 * @param conn The connection where the profile path was selected. The
 * VortexConnection object that was configured with the provided
 * profile path.
 *
 * @return Like \ref ModInitFunc "init" function, if this handler
 * returns axl_false the connection is closed. Keep in mind returning
 * axl_false will terminate current process.
