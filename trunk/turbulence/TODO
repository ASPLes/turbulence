CURRENT FRANCIS WORK
* Keep on working on turbulence mediator module to provide a low
  coupling interface to connect modules and API not known each
  other. 
    - Add regression test to check its function. 

    - Use this to implement mod-radmin allowing other modules to
      install its commands.

    - Add support to Libaxl to provide a way to dynamically extend a
      DTD definition allowing to include an piece of XML inside a
      document already validated with an DTD. Use this to include
      attributes an entire xml sections to implement the next point.

    - Use this to allow turbulence to check SASL users at
      turbulence.conf without being linked to mod-sasl.
    
    - Keep on working on tbc-ctl (check to reenable console
      stdout). Rewrite the tool to use PyVortex.

* Remove support for unloading modules. Is causing more problems than
  advantages. Add support for loading particular modules from inside
  profile paths.

* Test 10: extend test to check a serverName catched by default path
  name (to check first profile path is not matched).

* Test 10: extend test to check an unsupported serverName.

IDEAS & USEFUL HINTS

* It would be great to allow turbulence configuring which kind of
  frame types are expected to be received for each particular
  profile. This will save people from checking if they have received
  an allowed frame type.

* Investigate how useful would be signalling turbulence/vortex engine
  to do automatic empty replies in the case the frame received do not
  do this.

LONG TERM/NEED HELP ELEMENTS

* Make mod-sasl to support more SASL profiles (CRAM-MD5, DIGEST-MD5
and anonymous). 

* Create a mod-tls module to activate the TLS profile according to the
serverName received and other run time values. 

* Add support to mod-sasl and mod-tls to perform multihosting, that
is, providing different databases and certificates according to the
serverName (and maybe other configuration values).

* Create a connection manager to allow configuring a list of
connections that can be received by a single host.
