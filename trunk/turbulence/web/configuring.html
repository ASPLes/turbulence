<h2> <a name="how_is_configured">How turbulence is configured (configuration file location)</a></h2>
  
<p>Turbulence is configured through XML 1.0 files. The intention is
provide an easy and extensible way to configure turbulence, allowing
 third parties to build tools to update/reconfigure it. It is
also provided a DTD to ensure that configuration file created is
properly constructed at a minimum syntax level.</p>

  <p>According to your
 installation, the main turbulence configuration file should be
 found at the location provided by the following command: </p>
 
 <pre>

   >> turbulence --conf-location
   VERSION:         0.3.2.b3708.g3749
   VORTEX_VERSION:  1.1.0.b3749.g3749
   AXL_VERSION:     0.5.6.b3738.g3749
   SYSCONFDIR:      /etc
   TBC_DATADIR:     /usr/share
   Default configuration file: /etc/turbulence/turbulence.conf
 </pre>
 
 <p>Alternatively you can provide your own configuration file by using
 the <b>--config</b> option:  </p>
 
 <pre>

   >> turbulence --conf my-turbulence.conf
 </pre>

 <p>Turbulence main configuration file includes several global sections: </p>

 <ol>
 <li><p><b>&lt;global-settings></b>: This main section includes several
   run time configuration for the BEEP server: TCP ports, listener
   address, log files, crash handling, etc.</p>
 </li>

  <li>
    <p><b>&lt;modules></b>: Under this section is mainly configured
 directories holding modules.</p>
  </li>

 <li><p><b>&lt;profile-path-configuration></b>: Under this section is
  provided the profile path configuration, an administrative
  configuration which allows to mix, sequence, and select profiles to
  be provided to client peers according to several run time values
  such remote address, profiles already initiated, etc.. </p>
 </li>
</ol>

<h2> <a name="addresses_and_ports"> Turbulence addresses and ports used</a></h2>

<p> Ports and addresses used by Turbulence to listen are configured at
 the <b>&lt;global-settings></b> section. Here is an example: </p>
 
 <div class="xml-doc">
 <pre>

  &lt;<span class="node">global-settings</span>>
    <span class="comment">&lt;!-- ... more settings ... --></span>
 
    <span class="comment">&lt;!-- port to listen to --></span>
    &lt;<span class="node">ports</span>>
      &lt;<span class="node">port</span>>3206&lt;/<span class="node">port</span>>
      &lt;<span class="node">port</span>>44010&lt;/<span class="node">port</span>>
    &lt;/<span class="node">ports</span>>

    <span class="comment">&lt;!-- listener configuration (address to listen) --></span>
    &lt;<span class="node">listener</span>>
      &lt;<span class="node">name</span>>0.0.0.0&lt;/<span class="node">name</span>>
    &lt;/<span class="node">listener</span>>
  &lt;/<span class="node">global-settings</span>>
 </pre>
 </div> <!-- class=xml-doc -->

 <p>Previous example will make Turbulence to listen on ports 3206 and
 44010 for all addresses that are known for the server hosting
 turbulence (0.0.0.0). Turbulence will understand this section
 listening on all addresses provided, for all ports.</p>

 <p>Then you can use profile path to enforce which profiles will be
 served on each port. For example, you can provide TUNNEL support
 only on port 604 (though not recommended: see <a href="beep-applications-and-ports.html">Building wrong port oriented network applications</a>). </p>

<h2><a name="turbulence_debuging">Debugging turbulence and clean start</a></h2>

<p>During turbulence configuration you can use the <b>clean-start</b>
feature to ensure your turbulence configuration loads a server with
all features requested, failing to start if something goes wrong. This
is really useful to ensure a proper startup: for example all ports are
allocated. </p>

<p>This is configured inside the <b>global-settings</b> section:</p>

<pre>

   &lt;<span class="node">global-settings</span>>
      <span class="comment">&lt;!-- ... more settings ... --></span>

      <span class="comment">&lt;!--  Configure the default turbulence behavior to start or stop
            if a configuration or module error is found. By default
            Turbulence will stop if a failure is found.
        --></span>
      &lt;<span class="node">clean-start</span> value=<span class="attrvalue">"yes"</span> />
   &lt;/<span class="node">global-settings</span>>

</pre>

<p>Alternatively, during development or when it is found a turbulence
bug, it is handy to configure the default action to take on server
crash (bad signal received). This is done by configuring the following:</p>

<pre>

   &lt;<span class="node">global-settings</span>>
      <span class="comment">&lt;!--  ....more settings ....  --></span>
      <span class="comment">&lt;!--  crash settings 
       [*] hold:   lock the current instance so a developer can attach to the
                   process  to debug what's happening.

       [*] ignore: just ignore the signal, and try to keep running.

       [*] quit,exit: terminates turbulence execution.
      --></span>
      &lt;<span class="node">on-bad-signal</span> action=<span class="attrvalue">"hold"</span> />
   &lt;/<span class="node">global-settings</span>>

</pre>

<p>The <b>"hold"</b> option is really useful for real time debugging
because it hangs right after the signal is received. This allows to
launch the debugger and attach to the process to see what's
happening. Inside production environment it is recommended <b>"ignore"</b>.</p>


<h2><a name="configuring_log_files">Configuring turbulence log files</a></h2>

<p> Turbulence, its base library (libturbulence), modules and the
tools associated (using previous library) have two destinations where
logs are sent. The first default destination for log produced by the
turbulence server and its modules are sent to a set of files that are
configured at the at the <b>&lt;global-settings></b> section:</p>
 
 <div class="xml-doc">
 <pre>

    <span class="comment">&lt;!-- log reporting configuration --></span>
    &lt;<span class="node">log-reporting</span> enabled=<span class="attrvalue">"yes"</span>>
      &lt;<span class="node">general-log</span> file=<span class="attrvalue">"/var/log/turbulence/main.log"</span> />
      &lt;<span class="node">error-log</span>  file=<span class="attrvalue">"/var/log/turbulence/error.log"</span> />
      &lt;<span class="node">access-log</span> file=<span class="attrvalue">"/var/log/turbulence/access.log"</span> />
      &lt;<span class="node">vortex-log</span> file=<span class="attrvalue">"/var/log/turbulence/vortex.log"</span> />
    &lt;/<span class="node">log-reporting</span>>
 </pre>
 </div>

 <p>These files hold logs for general information
 (<b>&lt;general-log></b>), error information
 (<b>&lt;error-log></b>), client peer access information
 (<b>&lt;access-log></b>) and vortex engine log produced by its
 execution (<b>&lt;vortex-log></b>).</p>

 <p>Apart from the vortex log (<b>&lt;vortex-log></b>) the rest of
 files contains the information that is produced by all calls done
 to the following library functions: <b>msg</b>, <b>msg2</b>, <b>wrn</b> and <b>error</b>. </p>

 <p>By default, Turbulence server is started with no console
 output. All log is sent to previous log files. The second
 destination available is the console output. </p>

 <p>Four command line options controls logs produced to the console by
 Turbulence and tools associated:</p>

<ol>
  
 <li><p><b>--debug</b>: activates the console log, showing main
 messages. Turbulence tools have this option implicitly activated. </p></li>

 <li><p> <b>--debug2</b>: activates implicitly the <b>--debug</b> option
 and shows previous messages plus new messages that are considered
 to have more details.</p></li>

 <li><p><b>--debug3</b>: makes log output activated to include more
 details at the place it was launched (file and line), process pid,
 etc.</p></li>

 <li><p><b>--color-debug</b>: whenever previous options are activated, if
 this one is used, the console log is colored according to the
 kind of message reported: green (messages), red (error messages),
 yellow (warning messages).</p></li>

</ol>
 
 <p>If previous options are used Turbulence will register a log into
 the appropriate file but also will send the same log to the console.</p>

<h2><a name="modules_conf">Turbulence modules configuration</a></h2>
 
<p>Modules loaded by turbulence are found at the directories
configured in the <b>&lt;modules></b> section. Here is an example:</p>

 <div class="xml-doc">
 <pre>

  &lt;<span class="node">modules</span>>
    <span class="comment">&lt;!-- directory where to find modules to load --></span>
    &lt;<span class="node">directory</span> src=<span class="attrvalue">"/etc/turbulence/mods-enabled"</span> /> 
  &lt;/<span class="node">modules</span>>
 </pre>
 </div>
 
 <p>Every directory configured contains turbulence xml module pointers
 having the following content: </p>
 
 <div class="xml-doc">
 <pre>

 &lt;<span class="node">mod-turbulence</span> location=<span class="attrvalue">"/usr/lib/turbulence/modules/mod-sasl.so"</span> />
 </pre>
 </div>
 
<p>Each module have its own configuration file, which should use XML
 as default configuration format. </p>
 
<h2><a name="profile_path_conf">Profile path configuration</a></h2>

<p> Profile Path is a feature that allows to configure which
 profiles can be used by remote peers, according to several run time
 configurations. It is designed to make it easy to develop
 BEEP profile, that are later mixed with other profiles in many ways
 making them more useful through the combinations created at
 run-time.</p>
 
<p>Let's see some examples to initially clarify the profile path
 support. A usual configuration around BEEP is to provide SASL
 authentication and then allow using a profile which do useful
 work. The intention is to enforce a successful SASL negotiation, to later
provide a protected resource. </p>

<p>With profile path this can be configured as:</p>
 
 <div class="xml-doc">
 <pre>

 &lt;<span class="node">path-def</span> server-name=<span class="attrvalue">".*"</span> src=<span class="attrvalue">"not 192.168.0.*"</span> path-name=<span class="attrvalue">"not local-parts"</span>>
   &lt;<span class="node">if-success</span> profile=<span class="attrvalue">"http://iana.org/beep/SASL/.*"</span> connmark=<span class="attrvalue">"sasl:is:authenticated"</span>>
      &lt;<span class="node">allow</span> profile=<span class="attrvalue">"http://iana.org/beep/TUNNEL"</span> />
   &lt;/<span class="node">if-success</span>>
 &lt;/<span class="node">path-def</span>>
 </pre>
 </div>

<p> Previous example instruct Turbulence to apply a profile path called
 "not local-parts" if the source of the connection comes <i>"not from
 192.168.0.X"</i>. It also teaches Turbulence to only provide SASL
 profiles available and only once initiated properly (and authenticated),
 the remote client peer can use the TUNNEL profile. </p>

<p>Profile path is applied as a chain, composed by a set of <b>&lt;path-def></b>
 declarations. Once a <b>&lt;path-def></b> match the target, the profile path
 configuration found on it is applied to the peer, discarding the rest of <b>&lt;path-def></b> defined.  </p>
 
<div class="center"><img  src="images/profile-path-chain.png" alt="[PROFILE PATH CHAIN]"></div>

<p> As the previous image shows, the turbulence profile path
 configuration is composed by several profile path definitions: </p>
 
 <div class="xml-doc">
 <pre>

 &lt;<span class="node">path-def</span> server-name=<span class="attrvalue">".*"</span> src=<span class="attrvalue">"not 192.168.0.*"</span> path-name=<span class="attrvalue">"not local-parts"</span>>
   <span class="comment">&lt;!-- profile path configuration --></span>
 &lt;/<span class="node">path-def</span>>
 </pre>
 </div>
 
<p>Once a connection is received, a path-def is selected and the
configuration inside it is applied. If no path-def is selected, the
connection is rejected. </p>

<p>Every <b>&lt;path-def></b> supports the following matching configurations:</p>

<ol> 
 <li><p><b>server-name</b>: a perl expression defining the serverName
 to match for the connection. This can be used to only provide
  services based on a virtual hosting.</p></li>

 <li><p><b>src</b>: a perl expression defining the source of the
 connection. This can be used to only provide critical services to
  local administrators.</p></li>

 <li><p><b>path-name</b>: an administrative flag that will help to
 recognize the connection in future process (log reporting).</p></li>
 
</ol> 

<p> Once a path is matched, the following are discarded and the
 configuration inside the profile path is applied to the connection
 as long as the connection is running.</p>
 
<p> Now, it is required to configure which profiles will be
 allowed. This is done by using two types of nodes:</p>

<ol>
 
 <li><p><b>&lt;if-success></b>: a configuration that allows to use the
 profile referenced by it, and additionally, allows to use profiles
 provided by its child nodes once a channel with the profile
 provided is created.</p></li>

 <li><p><b>&lt;allow></b>: a configuration that allows to use a profile
 at a particular level. </p></li>

</ol>
 
<p> Let's see an example to show how it works:</p>
 
 <div class="xml-doc">
 <pre>

 <span class="comment">&lt;-- enforce all BEEP peers to do a successful SASL negotiation --></span>
 &lt;<span class="node">if-success</span> profile=<span class="attrvalue">"http://iana.org/beep/SASL/.*"</span>
             connmark=<span class="attrvalue">"sasl:is:authenticated"</span> >

    &lt;<span class="node">allow</span> profile=<span class="attrvalue">"http://turbulence.ws/profiles/test1"</span>
           preconnmark=<span class="attrvalue">"sasl:is:authenticated"</span>/>

    &lt;<span class="node">if-success</span> profile=<span class="attrvalue">"http://iana.org/beep/TLS"</span> >
       &lt;<span class="node">allow</span> profile=<span class="attrvalue">"http://iana.org/beep/xmlrpc"</span> />
       &lt;<span class="node">allow</span> profile=<span class="attrvalue">"http://fact.aspl.es/profiles/coyote_profile"</span> />
    &lt;/<span class="node">if-success</span>>

 &lt;/<span class="node">if-success</span>>
 </pre>
 </div>

<p> Previous example have configured a particular profile path as
 follows: </p>

<div class="center"><img src="images/profile-path-example.png" alt="[PROFILE PATH EXAMPLE]"></div>
 
<p> The example is mostly self-explanatory, but one detail remains. The
 configuration uses two attributes: <b>connmark</b> and
 <b>preconnmark</b>. They are used as flags that must be detected in
 the connection in other to allow the connection to accept a profile
 or the content of the following profiles.</p>

<h2> <a name="flags_allow_if_success">Profile path configuration: flags supported by &lt;allow> and &lt;if-success></a></h2>

<p>The following are the flags supported by <b>&lt;allow></b> and <b>&lt;if-success></b>:</p>

<ol>
 <li><p><b>preconnmark</b>: if used, it means that the connection must
 have the "mark" provided before the profile can be accepted to be
 initiated. SUPPORTED: &lt;allow>, &lt;if-success></p></li>
 
 <li><p><b>connmark</b>: can only be used from &lt;if-success> nodes, and
 allows to protect the profile path content inside the
 &lt;if-success> node, enforcing to not only create a channel under
 the profile provided but also having the mark. SUPPORTED:
 &lt;if-success></p>


 <p>This is particular
 useful for the SASL case because having a SASL channel created
 isn't a warranty of a connection authenticated. Thus, an additional
 mark is required to properly ensure that the connection was
 authenticated.</p></li>

 <li><p><b>max-per-con</b>: allows to configure the maximum amount of
 channels running the profile provided in the particular connection
instance. SUPPORTED: &lt;allow>, &lt;if-success></p></li>

</ol>
 
<p>So, a good question at this point is "how are those marks
 created?". These marks are profile dependant and are created using
 the interface provided by the vortex connection module to store
 data. You must check the profile documentation to know which marks
 are supported as they are particular to each BEEP profile. </p>
 
<p>In this case, Vortex Library SASL implementation flags the connection as
 authenticated using the provided flag: "sasl:is:authenticated".</p>
