<h1>Building port oriented applications and BEEP</h1>

<h2>Network application protocols state of the art</h2>

<p>All currently deployed application protocol such SMTP, HTTP, FTP,
  etc runs on a particular port making it more easy for developers and
  users to take advantage of the resource provided, because many
  settings are assumed. </p>

<p>In the past this approach was really helpful because many network
  design problems were solved for free: session setup, protocol
  identification, versioning, security level,..</p>

<p>For example, if it is required to "talk" plain HTTP you can use the
  default TCP port 80 to reach the web server at a particular
  location. However, if you want to secure your session you must use a
  different port, that is 443, because "by contract" the application
  protocol bind to the 80 port runs the HTTP without secure the
  session.</p>

<p>The same happens with many application protocols that must be
  secured, or "tuned", to provide a particular feature plus the
  application protocol that provides the resource required.</p>

<p>As everything, this has advantages: easy deployment, protocol
  location (many site administrators block applications not by content
  but by port), etc, but it also has drawbacks.</p>

<h2>Taking a look into limits imposed by port driven application protocols</h2>

<p>All features that provides "for free" a port driven approach are at
  the same time flaws in the long term. Taking separately we can see
  how they have a deep impact in our design. Understanding them its
  the first step to make a proper choice while designing network
  application protocols.</p>

<ol>
  <li><b>No or minimal protocol negotiation phase:</b>
  <p>Assuming you are going to find a particular application
  protocol at a particular port (i.e, SMTP on 25 TCP port) you can
  skip all details that could
  require peer connection, identify your credentials and then ask for your
  protocol.</p>

  <p>However, if the protocol requires to be mixed or extended with
  some feature that falls outside the protocol scope or capability it
  is now required to talk to "a new" version of the protocol in a
  different port. Obviously this is far from being desired but happens
  specially with protocols that are previous to the SSL/TLS
  appearance. </p>

  <p>In this case, the port driven approach uses a new port. In the
  case of BEEP a new BEEP profile is provided, making it to be
  available at the same port, making old and new client applications
  to coexist.</p>

  </li>
  <li><b>Port bound protocol: </b>
  <p>Until now, a common idiom is to assume the port according to the
  protocol being used and viceversa. Though it is argued that it makes more easy
  software development and makes life easy to end users, some
  experience shows that it is required to be able to move services to
  different ports. </p>
  <p>However, in many cases this is not possible because, again, the
  application protocol design. So, <i>why design an application protocol
  that is "married" with a particular port?</i>  </p>

  <p>The answer was two fold: first, there was nothing like BEEP that
  could help two different application protocols to coexist at the same TCP
  port, making difficult to move applications to different
  ports. Second, it is supposed it is easy for client applications to
  reach the server side application assuming the TCP port.</p>

  <p>While the first answer is pretty clear, the second is not so
  accurate now having BEEP. A really flexible approach would be to
  have a "default port" where the application server is usually reached but,
  it should be possible to place the server application at a different
  one. </p>

  <p>It is difficult to understand that, in many cases, current client
  Internet applications doesn't provide a TCP port configuration to
  reach the server application because "it is too much setting for the
  end user!!". </p>
 </li>
 
 <li><b>Being one step ahead to the change</b>
 <p>Many experienced network application designers take into account
 that features not envisioned by its protocols will happen. Several
 measures are provided, but the most common is versioning the
 protocol. However, this do not solve all problems as showed with the
 TLS/SSL case.</p>

 <p>BEEP provides a flexible and powerful mechanism to perform a
 session setup, allowing to mix and extend your protocol (a
 BEEP profile) with several existing BEEP profiles. </p>

 <p>This is great not
 only because the amount of work already done, but because it is a warranty
 that the change that will happen will be covered easily by new BEEP
 profiles, making your protocol to be fresh and up to date.</p>

 <p>For example, the Af-Arch platform <a
 href="http://fact.aspl.es">[1]</a> provides its RPC services through
 two profiles at the same time. This allows client applications
 to use the <i>"Coyote"</i> or the <i>"XML-RPC over BEEP"</i>
 profile to invoke services. </p>

 <p>This is done because initially the <i>Coyote profile</i> was
 defined to perform a XML-RPC invocation without too much
 features (really limited protocol) but simple enough for the kind of
 services exposed by Af-Arch servers. With the time Shaper <a
 href="https://dolphin.aspl.es/svn/publico/shaper/">[2]</a> was written and a XML-RPC invocation profile with
 support for data typing was required. </p>

 <p>Obviously rewriting the <i>"Coyote profile"</i> was not a
 reasonable option. Having BEEP allowed to support
 over the same connection <i>"Coyote"</i> and <i>"XML-RPC over
 BEEP"</i> which fitted really well due to its data typing support. </p>
 </li>
</ol>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The very first concept to change while building applications with
BEEP is to not think about running a particular BEEP profile at a
particular port. This is because BEEP is able to run any
configuration at any port due to its design.</p>

<p>A little experience with BEEP and its building block reuse pattern
shows that several BEEP profiles are used and combined to produce the
"useful work" at the same port (without being important this last detail).</p>

<p>For example, you can run a mixture of XML-RPC over BEEP, SASL and
TLS, with a custom profile to provide some service. In this case, you
can use the IANA port assigned to the XML-RPC over BEEP, 602 TCP port,
but once connected you are in fact running several protocols on port
602. </p>

<p>What happens is that your client application reached the 602 TCP
port, negotiated a TLS tuning to secure your connection, then
provided SASL credentials, and then asked to use the XML-RPC over BEEP
profile. But, at this last step, your client application could have
asked for other BEEP profile.</p>

<p>It is recommended to design BEEP applications to use as "default
port" anyone provided for current IANA BEEP accepted profiles, but at
the same time, allowing to move that application to any port. The same
applies to new BEEP profiles with IANA assigned ports. These ports
should be taken only as "default" values.  </p>

<p>Some of IANA assigned ports to BEEP profiles are:</p>
