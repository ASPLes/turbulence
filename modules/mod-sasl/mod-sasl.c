 * \section turbulence_mod_sasl_intro Introduction
 *
 * <b>mod-sasl</b> module provides user authentication to Turbulence. Inside
 * BEEP, the SASL protocol is used by default to provide user
 * authentication.
 *
 * \section turbulence_mod_sasl_configuration Base configuration
 *
 * <b>mod-sasl</b> is a module that provides SASL support for turbulence. It
 * includes facilities to configure which SASL profiles can be enabled
 * and the users database to be used.
 *
 * This module is included in the Turbulence official distribution. To
 * enable it you must make it available at some of the directories
 * that are used by Turbulence to load modules (see \ref
 * turbulence_modules_configuration). Under most cases this is done as
 * follows:
 *
 * \code
 *   >> cd /etc/turbulence/mod-enabled
 *   >> ln -s ../mod-available/mod-sasl.xml
 * \endcode
 *
 *
 * Once included the module you must restart Turbulence. Now the
 * <b>mod-sasl</b> is activated you must configure it. This is done by
 * updating <b>sasl.conf</b> file which is usually located at
 * <b>/etc/turbulence/sasl/sasl.conf</b>. Here is an example:
 * 
 * \htmlinclude sasl.example.conf.tmp
 *
 * Previous configuration file example states that there is a default
 * authentication database (no <b>serverName</b> configured), using the md5
 * format to store passwords (<b>format</b>), storing such user and password
 * using the default xml backend provided by turbulence (<b>type</b>), which
 * is located at the file provided (<b>location</b>).
 *
 * The two remaining parameters (<b>remote-admins</b> and <b>remote</b>) allows to
 * configure the remote <b>mod-sasl</b> xml-rpc based administration
 * interface and to configure the set of allowed users that could use
 * this interface. See later for more details.
 *
 * The rest of the file configures the allowed SASL profiles to be
 * used by remote peers. Currently we only support plain.  Virtual
 * host configuration for SASL module
 *
 * Previous example shows how to configure the default backend used
 * for all <b>serverName</b> configurations. Inside BEEP, once a channel is
 * created, it is allowed to configure the <b>serverName</b> parameter asking
 * the server to act using such role. This value can be used to select
 * the proper auth backend configuration.
 *
 * How the <b>mod-sasl</b> selects the proper auth-db is done as follows:
 *
 * <ol>
 *
 *  <li>If the SASL request is being received in a connection which
 *  has the <b>serverName</b> parameter configured (either due to a previous
 *  channel created or due to the current SASL channel exchange), then
 *  it is searched a <b><auth-db></b> node with matches the <b>serverName</b>
 *  parameter.</li>
 *
 *  <li>If no match is found in the previous search, it is used the
 *  first <b><auth-db></b> node found without the <b>serverName</b>
 *  attribute configured. That is, the <b><auth-db></b> node
 *  configured without <b>serverName</b> is used as fallback default
 *  auth-db for all auth operations.</li>
 *
 * </ol>
 *
 * \section turbulence_mod_sasl_work_dir Using work-dir attribute to set an user defined SASL database
 *
 * In the case the profile path under which the connection is running
 * have <b>work-dir</b> attribute defined, then mod-sasl will try to
 * load <b>sasl.conf</b> from that work-dir. If not found, system sasl.conf
 * file will be loaded.
 *
 * The idea is to allow a user with access to a working directory (and
 * a configured profile path poiting to it) to manage its own
 * database.
 *
 * \section turbulence_mod_sasl_cli Command line interface to the mod-sasl: tbc-sasl-conf
 *
 * If you have a shell account into the turbulence machine, you can
 * use the <b>tbc-sasl-conf</b> tool to update users database (<b>auth-db.xml</b>),
 * rather than editing directly. You can add a user using the
 * following:
 *
 * \code
 *   >> tbc-sasl-conf --add-user beep-test
 *   I: adding user: beep-test..
 *   Password:
 *   Type again:
 *   I: user beep-test added!
 * \endcode
 *
 *
 * You can use the --serverName option to select the auth-db to be
 * used by the tool.
 *
 * \code
 *   >> tbc-sasl-conf --add-user beep-test --serverName beep.aspl.es
 *   I: adding user: beep-test..
 *   Password:
 *   Type again:
 *   I: user beep-test added!
 * \endcode
 *
 * Use <b>tbc-sasl-conf --help</b> to get full help.
 *
 * \section turbulence_mod_sasl_ramdin SASL-RADMIN: xml-rpc interface to manage SASL databases
 *
 * Starting from Turbulence 0.3.0, it is included a xml-rpc interface
 * that allows full management for all sasl databases installed. This
 * interface is mainly provided as a way to integrate into third party
 * applications the possibility to manage users, passwords, etc for
 * applications developed.
 * 
 * The following are a minimal set of instructions that will serve you
 * as starting point to integrate and use SASL-RADMIN.
 *
 * <ol>
 *
 *   <li>First you must locate the idl interface installed in your
 *   system. This is the sasl-radmin.idl file. On systems where
 *   pkg-config is available you can find it by using the following:
 *
 * \code
 *   >> pkg-config --cflags sasl-radmin
 *   /usr/share/mod-sasl/radmin/sasl-radmin.idl
 * \endcode
 *
 *  </li>
 *
 *  <li>This idl file includes not only the interface definition but
 *  also the code for all services provided. To build the C client
 *  interface, so you can perform XML-RPC invocations, you can do:
 *
 * \code
 *  >> xml-rpc-gen --out-stub-dir . --only-client --disable-main-file
 *                 --disable-autoconf /usr/share/mod-sasl/radmin/sasl-radmin.idl
 * \encode
 *
 * In the case your system has pkg-config, you can do the following:
 *
 * \code
 *  >> xml-rpc-gen --out-stub-dir . --only-client --disable-main-file
 *                   --disable-autoconf `pkg-config --cflags sasl-radmin`
 *  [ ok ] compiling: /usr/share/mod-sasl/radmin/sasl-radmin.idl..

 *  [ ok ] compilation ok
 * \endcode
 *
 * Don't mind about EE messages about missing files. Those ones are
 * used by the server side component, which is not your case. Along
 * with the output, the command list the set of files installed.
 * </li>
 *
 * <li>This will build a set of files that must be integrated into
 * your client application according to your building tools. For
 * autoconf users just include that files into your <b>"product_SOURCES"</b>
 * directive. See Vortex xml-rpc-gen tool documentation for more
 * information for an initial explanation.</li>
 * 
 * <li>As a last step, you must activate the remote administration on
 * each domain that will be allowed to do so. This done by using the
 * <b>remote</b> and <b>remote-admins</b> attributes. The first one must be set to
 * <b>"yes"</b>. The second must point to a db-list having a list of allowed
 * SASL administrators. See \ref turbulence_db_list_management to setup the
 * administrator list.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * \section turbulence_mod_sasl_mysql Using MySQL to auth SASL accounts
 *
 * This section assumes you already have installed <b>mod-sasl-mysql</b>
 * either due to source "make install" or because your distribution
 * provides a package to install it. To check it, look if you have a
 * file called <b>extension.modules</b> located at
 * ${sysconfdir}/turbulence/sasl directory. To know your sysconfdir
 * value use:
 *
 * \code
 * >> turbulence --conf-location
 * \endcode
 *
 * Inside that file (<b>exension.modules</b>) you should find a
 * declaration like follows:
 *
 * \htmlinclude extension.example.modules.xml
 *
 * To use a MySQL database to auth SASL accounts you must first
 * prepare your MySQL server with some SQL to store those users
 * accounts and prepare your SQL queries to adapt your particular
 * structure. There is no fixed or expected SQL structure, so you can
 * adapt the following example with no problem.
 *
 * The following is a working example used by Turbulence regression
 * test to check <b>mod-sasl-mysql</b> module. It will work in most
 * situations so you can start with it. Connect to your database and
 * run the following. Rembember to change user and password:
 *
 * \include create-mysql-sasl-database.sql
 *
 * Now you need to enable this database to by used by mod-sasl. This
 * is done by updating your <b>sasl.conf</b> (usually found at
 * /etc/turbulence/sasl/sasl.conf) to have a declaration like follows:
 *
 * \code
 *  <!-- mysql database backend format -->
 *  <auth-db type="mysql" 
 *           location="auth-db.mysql.xml" 
 *           format="md5" />
 * \endcode
 *
 * Note that this <b><auth-db></b> declaration do not provide a
 * <b>serverName</b> value. This means it will be used for all auth
 * requests if no other especific database is found for the provided
 * serverName and no other default database is found prior this
 * one. In the case you want to use MySQL only for a particular
 * serverName, set it.
 *
 * Now you have registered this <b><auth-db></b> database,
 * <b>mod-sasl</b> will redirect requests to
 * <b>mod-sasl-mysql</b>. Fine, but now you need to tell
 * mod-sasl-mysql how to handle requests. To do so, fill the
 * <b>auth-db.mysql.xml</b> file with the following:
 *
 * \htmlinclude auth-db.mysql.example.xml-tmp
 *
 * As you can see the file is self explanatory. There is a declaration
 * to provide connection settings to reach the MySQL server and a
 * declaration with the SQL required to get the password.
 *
 * Reached this point you are now able to SASL auth your users using a
 * MySQL database. However..
 *
 * \section turbulence_mod_sasl_creating_password Format and how to create hashed passwords compatible with mod-sasl
 *
 * ..an important detail is how to generate the format used to store
 * the password.  In the case use "plain" format
 * (<b>format="plain"</b> attribute declaration inside
 * <b><auth-db></b>) then nothing especial is required. In the case
 * you use md5 or sha-1 you must hash the password using the
 * corresponding method, upper case the result, and inverleave a ":"
 * sign each 2 positions. For example:
 *
 * \code
 * Plain password: test
 * MD5:            09:8F:6B:CD:46:21:D3:73:CA:DE:4E:83:26:27:B4:F6
 * SHA-1:          A9:4A:8F:E5:CC:B1:9B:A6:1C:4C:08:73:D3:91:E9:87:98:2F:BB:D3
 * \endcode
 *
 * At the same time, it is also supported all password formats
 * provided by crypt(3) API, which looks like:
 *
 * \code
 * >> python
 * Python 2.6.6 (r266:84292, Dec 26 2010, 22:31:48) 
 * [GCC 4.4.5] on linux2
 * Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
 * >>> import crypt
 * >>> crypt.crypt ("my-password", "$1$salt")
 * '$1$salt$2UXoCqj/ltHf23Mz35S8u.'
 * >>> crypt.crypt ("my-password", "$5$salt")
 * '$5$salt$EBjPwW99d3EHw71rYuAncvySWwz9r/4NKupG0DQ8vyC'
 * >>> crypt.crypt ("my-password", "$6$salt")
 * '$6$salt$8y2PAuMRzsJn8tKxsjgEfs6mGY7zT9Fv6wEd3WBAP69p6glnYZeIJn179monOoNtrhRmaJE1glw8zZXYLcznD.'
 * \endcode

 * Along with mod-sasl code is included a python script that can help
 * you generating these passwords and as example of code so your
 * application can generate those passwords too. The application is
 * <b>gen-mod-sasl-pass.py</b>, and its content is:
 *
 * \include gen-mod-sasl-pass.py
 *
 * To generate passwords do the following:
 * 
 * \code
 * >> gen-mod-sasl-pass.py md5 YOUR_PASSWORD
 * \endcode
 *
 * \section turbulence_mod_sasl_search_path Configuring mod-sasl search path
 *
 * Currently, mod-sasl searches for sasl.conf and associated files
 * looking for them in the following other:
 *
 * - First is checked if the user provided a \ref turbulence_profile_path_search "&lt;search> path" declaration using the domain <b>"sasl"</b>. In that case, the path configure is used.
 *
 * - Then is checked if profile path has a <b>work-dir</b> attribute. If so, this is used.
 *
 * - Finally default location is used (in Linux it is /etc/turbulence/sasl). Run turbulence --conf-location to know where is the base directory located by looking where is found the default configuration file.
