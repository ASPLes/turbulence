Release note
~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Advanced Software Production Line is proud to announce Turbulence
  0.6.4 "Common People" release: an open source BEEP application
  server, written on top of Vortex Library 1.1.

  Turbulence is a BEEP server extensible through modules which allows
  to implement server side profiles that are used and combined then
  with other profiles through run time configuration.

  Turbulence is written to make it easy to develop and deploy BEEP
  profiles, allowing developers to provide a convenient configuration
  interface to site administrators and end users.

Changes since the 0.6.4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* [fix] Finished support for crypt(3) API for mod-sasl and
  mod-sasl-mysql extension plugin. Now the module is able to auth old
  passwords and passwords crypted by crypt(3) API. Added regression
  test (test_03a) to check support introduced and added documentation
  to mod-sasl to explain how to use it.

* [fix] Updated common-sasl.c code to define _GNU_SOURCE just if it is
  not defined..

* [fix] Updated mod-sasl-mysql extension library to allow implementing
  alternative auth locations with <get-password-alt> and
  <get-password-alt-cleanup>. This new feature is been used by
  Core-Admin to provide auto login features

* [fix] Updated mod_sasl_mysql to use ATTR_VALUE_TRANS when getting
  values from xml configuration so administrators can use xml escaped
  characters like (' apos).

* [fix] Adding directory test/test_15_datadir (with empty file so
  github.com allows to import it).

* [fix] Fixed compilation errors spotted by gcc (5.3.1)

* [fix] Several improvements inside turbulence_process_receive_socket
  function to better report errors during the process. Added especial
  case to detect loopback interface failures..

* [fix] Making master<->child link creation to report addresses, errno
  codes and indications when vortex_connection_new for master link
  fails..

* [fix] Making turbulence server to check vortex_support_pipe () to
  avoid starting in the case a failure is found. Without that API
  turbulence cannot work properly.
  
* [fix] Clear memory before calling read bytes from the wire inside
  turbulence conn mgr module (proxy mode).

* [fix] Updated turbulence-conn-mgr module (proxy read code) to use
  try_read_pending API provided by vortex to do more read calls when
  detected pending code to read. Fixes interation with
  SSL+WebSocket+BEEP

* [fix] Corrected libturbulence-mod-python descriptions for debian
  packages..

* [fix] Improved turbulence init.d script to avoid killing it self
  when calling to restart..

* [fix] Updated Turbulence Profile Path selection to setup max frame
  limit at connection level as connection is notified accepted.

* [fix] Updated code for turbulence-ppath module to clean state freed,
  and additional code checking path mask selection.

* [fix] Increased timeout to finish child process when found no
  connection to watch.

* [fix] Added code to detect if turbulence context is exiting before
  calling for profile path selection after connection registration.

* [fix] Updated turbulence_ctx_exit to flag at the very beginning that
  the context is in the process of closing. Added some reporting to
  show what is closing (child or master process).

* [fix] Updated configure.ac to use get-python-config to adapt
  compilation to support python2.7 where python3.X is default
