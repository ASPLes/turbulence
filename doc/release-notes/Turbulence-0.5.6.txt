Release note
~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Advanced Software Production Line is proud to announce Turbulence
  0.5.6 "Shake it out" release: an open source BEEP application
  server, written on top of Vortex Library 1.1.

  Turbulence is a BEEP server extensible through modules which allows
  to implement server side profiles that are used and combined later
  with other profiles through run time configuration.

  Turbulence is written to make it easy to develop and deploy BEEP
  profiles, allowing developers to provide a convenient configuration
  interface to site administrators and end users.

The release in short
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  New stable release that includes bug fixings

Change notifications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  None.

Changes since the 0.5.5
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* [new] Updated turbulence context handler to record a reference to
  the context itself into the vortex context. Also added new macro to
  get VortexCtx from TurbulenceCtx. API added:

   - VORTEX_TBC_CTX

* [fix] Making turbulence conn mgr to log errors found on connections
  that are closed. Skipped typical errors to avoid logging frequent
  errors (like connection closed by remote peer, and similar).

* [fix] Fixed turbulence reg tests to conform latest vortex changes..

* [new] Updated turbulence module API to include a function that
  allows configuring if a particular module should be unmapped when
  close.  Used this to avoid unmapping mod-python, which later gives
  problems if it is loaded again into the same process. Updated
  regression test to use this. API added:

   - turbulence_module_skip_unmap

* [fix] Making python tests to be executed only if requested by the
  tester. This is to avoid python poor support to init and finalize
  several times the engine.
  
* [fix] Fixed wrong reference to libmysqlclient16, replaced by
  libmysqlclient15off in debian lenny.

* [fix] Fixed memory leak inside turbulence-conn-mgr module when
  connections errors are showed.

* [fix] Several updates to remove clean start concept which was
  providing more problems than solving them. Updated base
  configuration and documentation to remove all references to this
  concept. Checked regression tests and updated them accordingly to
  reflect the change. This won't break deployed/working
  configurations...

* [new] Updated turbulence-ctl command to read current radmin.conf
  file found inside /etc/turbulence/profile.d to detect declared
  serverName so now it is possible to use a random serverName value to
  better integrate with deployed profile paths. Also updated the tool
  to detect if SASL is enabled (as declared inside radmin.conf) so the
  tool directly start SASL before proceeding creating radmin-ctl
  channel.

* [new] Added new script that properly setup the radmin module, creating
  all files and user databases. Script added:

  - tbc-setup-mod-radmin.py

* [fix] Updated tbc-setup-mod-radmin.py to also detect and enable
  mod-radmin in case it isn't.

* [fix] Updated debian files to include libturbulence-mod-radmin.

* [fix] Adding debian missing files..

* [fix] Fixed wrong reference to turbulence-config from mod-radmin.

* [fix] More debian updates..

* [new] Updated turbulence context creation to track when it was
  created. Now this value is used by mod-radmin status to report how
  long (in seconds) was the server running.

* [fix] Updated mod-radmin status command to report more info about
  run time server status.

* [new] Updated mod-radmin to include a new command (show channels) to
  show all channels running in all connections handled by the server
  (including their children).

 * [fix] Fixed console table size calculation at turbulence-ctl
   command.

* [fix] Skipping master listener connections from be showed by "show
  channels" command inside mod-radmin.

* [fix] Fixed turbulence_support_smtp_send to include an additional
  \r\n when sending files.

* [fix] Removed unuseful info from conn mgr module..

* [fix] Removed debug messages from conn mgr modules..

* [fix] Making kill conn command to check if : is present in the kill
  spec.

* [fix] Updated PyTurbulenceCtx to include a new function msg2 that
  wraps turbulence's msg2.

* [fix] Making mod-sasl-mysql to not filter auth request for users
  that aren't available so no "auth filtered" message is shown when
  non existent users..
