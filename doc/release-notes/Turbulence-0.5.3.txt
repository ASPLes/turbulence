Release note
~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Advanced Software Production Line is proud to announce Turbulence
  0.5.3 "Memories of Green" release: an open source BEEP application
  server, written on top of Vortex Library 1.1.

  Turbulence is a BEEP server extensible through modules which allows
  to implement server side profiles that are used and combined later
  with other profiles through run time configuration.

  Turbulence is written to make it easy to develop and deploy BEEP
  profiles, allowing developers to provide a convenient configuration
  interface to site administrators and end users.

The release in short
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Many updates to mod-python like allowing loading python applications
  using python.conf files located at the profile path working
  directory. This allows easy application installation delegation
  because working directory is usually owned by the user running the
  profile path.

  Added initial fully working mod-radmin module that allows getting
  instant information about turbulence runtime status (including its
  children) so you can view all connections handled (parent and children)
  and other useful information.

  This release also includes several bug fixes and new regression
  tests to check turbulence function.
  

Change notifications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  None.

Changes since the 0.5.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* [fix] Updated internal log handling to support log reloading after
  SIGHUP received (closing and reopen file descriptors). Added
  turbulence-logrotate.d base file to implement rotation. Updated
  turbulence-init.d to properly notify start/stop.

* [fix] Adding restart cmd into debian post inst installer.

* [fix] Committing debian changes..

* [fix] Making mod-python to allow loading site python.conf
  applications along with applications defined at
  /etc/turbulence/python/python.conf Nice!!

* [fix] Several memory allocation checks at the message logging
  code.

* [fix] Updated mod-python documentation to explain how to use site
  python.conf declaration.

* [fix] Updating version files..

* [fix] Making turbulence_signal_install to remove signal handlers
  installed when enable flag is false to avoid inheriting handlers
  installed on parent.

* [fix] Fixed memory leak inside mod-mysql-sasl when ip filter is
  empty. Ensured SASL dtd is cleared when a failure is found.

* [fix] Updated mod-python documentation to explain how to get profile
  path working dir once python app is activated.

* [fix] Several updates to tbc-ctl tool to process incoming command
  results. Still more work is required.

* [new] General engine update to allow creating a BEEP connection
  between parent and children created. This connection is generic (is a
  BEEP connection!) and at this moment is being used by mod-radmin to
  implement turbulence management and status notification. GREAT!

  Added turbulence regression test to check connection creation and
  its status: test_10-b.

* [new] Added first fully working/checked mod-radmin and
  turbulence-ctl tool that allows getting real-time state for a
  running turbulence process. For now, the tandem supports:

    - showing connections on master parent and all children
    - showing all children
    - getting turbulence process status
    - killing children and connections (on master and children process: nice!!).

* [fix] General engine work to ensure regression tests releases all
  parent memory at child process to allow easy memory leak and proper
  memory access using valgrind.  Until know there where too many
  errors to make valgrind reports to be usable (mainly due to python
  and valgrind interaction).  Fixed many bugs and memory wrong access
  (and some leaks ;-).

* [new] Added new module to handle turbulence child process object
  (and related elements). API added:

  - turbulence_child_new
  - turbulence_child_ref
  - turbulence_child_unref

* [fix] General update at the turbulence context module to acquire a
  reference to the vortex ctx object associated and to release it at
  the very end. Updated API to include a method that allows checking
  if the current turbulence context is associated (or it is) a
  child. API added:

   - turbulence_ctx_is_child

* [fix] Updated turbulence finalization to do module cleanup at the
  very last step to allow module code to be available until the end of
  the turbulence context.  Also updated the code to not release vortex
  context associated when it is detected not enough references (which
  shows wrong module/turbulence engine programming) but instead of
  breaking, drop an error log.

* [fix] Several updates on turbulence conn mgr module to avoid using
  state object and to start using TurbulenceCtx as a step before
  getting such object which is more safe (fixes memory wrong access
  and some races showed by valgrind).

* [fix] Updated mod-sasl to allow loading extension.modules file from
  "sasl" domain context defined
  (vortex_support_domain_find_data_file). Also updated the module to
  release mod_msyql_sasl dtd on close.

* [fix] Making mod-python to detect if some python app was loaded at
  the parent (causing the python engine to be initialized as well) to
  avoid starting on child process.  There is no way to make python to
  work after a fork without an execve operation.  Instead of breaking
  mysteriously, making the module to refuse loading giving a concrete
  error message.

* [fix] Added --version support to show current turbulence compiled
  version.

* [fix] Reorganized mod-python loading code to load site and system
  config files before initializing python (to avoid problems at the
  children).

* [fix] Making turbulence_ctx_free to check if internal vortex_ctx
  reference is defined to avoid using it to drop warnings..

* [fix] Updated mod-python to avoid calling clean start at application
  initialization.

* [fix] Changed log on mod-sasl-mysql reporting IP not filtered.
