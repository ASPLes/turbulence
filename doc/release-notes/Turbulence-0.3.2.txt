Release note
~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Advanced Software Production Line is proud to announce the
  Turbulence 0.3.2 "Vicarious" release: an open source BEEP
  application server, written on top of Vortex Library 1.1.

  Turbulence is a BEEP server extensible through modules and allows to
  implement server side profiles that are used and combined later with
  other profiles through run time configuration.

  Turbulence is written to make easy to develop and deploy BEEP
  profiles, allowing developers to provide a convenient configuration
  interface to site administrators and end users.

Change notifications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  None.

Changes since the 0.3.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* [fix] Added initial changes to make turbulence to be compilable on
  windows. More work required.

  windows platform is detected. Updated main entry point to show
  parameters configured if provided --conf-location (SYSCONFDIR,
  TBC_DATADIR, VERSION).

* [fix] mod-sasl: Updated installation process and file names to not
  overwrite existing sasl configuration installed on the
  system. Making configuration files and auth backend to be installed
  as examples.

  path. Bug exposed by the windows platform.

* [fix] Commiting missing Makefile.win files...

* [fix] mod-sasl: fixing wrong remote-admins.xml base file creation

* [fix] Updated Makefile.am files to remove the reference to DATADIR,
  making all the code to use the turbulence_datadir () function.

* [fix] More updates to the Makefile.am files to remove references to
  -DSYSCONFDIR no longer valid. Updated modules to include into the
  distribution all *.win32.xml files (module pointers).

* [fix] Updating source code due to change notification inside vortex.
  Updated Makefile.am process to get a reference to new
  vortex-tunnel-1.1 location.

* [fix] Several updates to conform changes on Vortex 1.1 API.

* [fix] Updated documentation adding missing modules (turbulence ctx).

* [fix] Moved all project files to utf-8 encoding.

   - turbulence_ctx_set_data_full
   - turbulence_ctx_get_data

* [fix] Fixed turbulence_create_dir which wasn't using a proper mode
  value while calling to mkdir.

* [fix] Fixed profile path implementation to take advantage of the
  change introduced (vortex-profile-mask-func-01).

* [fix] Making turbulence to use the new component
  libvortex-xml-rpc-1.1.  Updated mod-sasl code to use new XML-RPC
  module.

* [fix] General update to the turbulence mod-sasl code to use the new
  sasl independent component.

* [fix] General update to make turbulence to conform the new API
  provided by vortex-1.1.

* [fix] Fixed autoconf installation to include sasl example files.
  Updated autoconfigure notification about missing libpcre to warn the
  user with the features that will be disabled.

  and turbulence-db-list.dtd to support being included in-line.

* [new] mod-sasl: updated mod-sasl to support dropping connections
  that have an attempt to log with an account disabled
  (accounts-disabled). Added support to limit number of tries for SASL
  logins until the connection is dropped (max-allowed-tries).

* [new] mod-sasl: Updated sasl-radmin.idl definition to check if a user exists 
  before creating the account. Updated common-sasl module to also check
  this.

* [new] mod-sasl: Making mod-sasl to also support clean-start feature.

* [new] tbc-mod-gen: Making the tool to include the DTD inside the
  code.

* [fix] Disabled libexarg dependency, now included at compilation
  time. This will save people from including a library with two
  files. Updated Makefiles to allow updating them.

* [new] Updated turbulence-db-list module to inline DTD used to
  validate lists loaded. Now the code do not require an external DTD
  to work.

* [new] Moved clean-start attribute into the context (TurbulenceCtx)
  to avoiding making several context to use the same value.

* [new] General update into the profile path module to move the
  regular expression support into a new module allowing not only the
  ppath module to use it but modules extending turbulence. API added:

   - TurbulenceExpr (type)
   - turbulence_expr_compile
   - turbulence_expr_match
   - turbulence_expr_free

* [new] Making turbulence-config to load its DTD from an inline
  definition created and maintained by axl-knife.

  module unload and similar situations (handlers accessing to memory
  regions not available).

  pointers with a in-line DTD. Moved into the public API, directory
  module loading function. API added:

   - turbulence_run_load_modules_from_path

* [new] Moved clean-start checking into the public API to allow
  turbulence modules to also implement clean start. API added:

   - CLEAN_START (macro, simple access)
   - turbulence_run_check_clean_start (implementation).

* [fix] Making turbulence server to activate debug, with terminal
  colors if --color-debug is found (no longer requiring to also
  provide --debug).

* [fix] Updated configure process to make no longer required to have
  libexarg installed. Making libpcre to be a required dependency
  rather optional like until now. Several fixings into the regression
  test.

* [fix] mod-sasl: committing change into dtd to allow defining
  serverName domain to which applies the sasl auth backend.

* [fix] Committing changes to compile on windows and run regression
  test.

* [fix] Updates to conform axl-bool-removal-01 change notification.

* [fix] Making turbulence to force using new axl and vortex versions.
  Updated mod-tunnel to avoid using vortex_tunnel_is_enabled. Function
  no longer available.

* [new] Added portable unlink function. API added:

  - turbulence_unlink

* [fix] mod-sasl: making remote administration to be disabled if
  remote is configured to "no", even having a DB configured.

  vortex.

* [fix] Removing BOSH references...

* [new] Added initial support for debian packages.

* [new] Added support to start in background (--detach option).

* [fix] More debian package fixings.

* [new] Added initial support for --pidfile which allows to configure
  a file where the effective process identifier will be placed.

* [fix] Fixed configuration example to be usable without modification.

* [new] Adding turbulence init.d file

* [fix] Fixed SIGHUP handling for server reconfiguration. The signal
  wasn't armed after handling the signal.

* [new] Making turbulence to create a pidfile used by init scripts to
  better support service stop/start.

* [new] Added initial working init.d script for turbulence.

* [fix] Initial finished support for debian packages for turbulence.

* [fix] Minor changes to remove false/true references replaced by
  axl_false/axl_true.

  get this information).  Used this macro to flag all critical startup
  errors. API added:

   - abort_error
