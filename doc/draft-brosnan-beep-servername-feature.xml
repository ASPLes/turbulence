    <t>This document defines one feature for the BEEP <xref
    target="RFC3080" /> protocol that allows to request serverName value at session
   initialization.</t>

<t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
target="RFC2119"/>.</t>
</section>


<section title='Motivation'>

<t>BEEP allows to define the serverName under which a
connection/session will act. This provides fundamental administrative
features for virtual servers (like provisioning particular values according to
such serverName value). </t>

<t>As defined in "2.3.1.2 The Start Message" (inside <xref
target="RFC3080" />), serverName value is established on the first
successful channel opened requesting such value, causing the
connection/session to be bound to such value. Next channels opened
requesting other serverName values are ignored.</t>

<t>The serverName feature presented (for now x-serverName feature) is
defined to allow a connecting BEEP peer to signal serverName value
desired at the beginning of the session/connection, without waiting
the first channel to be opened.</t>

<t>The intention is to provide an easy mechanism for BEEP listeners to
decide providing services according to requested serverName, without
waiting to channel start requests.</t>

<t>The mechanism is entirely optional due to BEEP features nature, but
when available, will provide a clear path to provide services for only
a set of serverNames available. It is worth to mention this feature do
not fix nor provide any missing feature; it just provide a
simply way for both listener and initiator to setup serverName.</t>

</section>

<section title='Use cases for serverName feature'>

<section title='Listener view: provide services for a set of domains'>

<t>For a general purpose BEEP server, in the case it is required to
provide a different profile policy according to the serverName, it is
required to delay such provisioning </t>

</section>

<section title='Requesting a BEEP session with serverName'>

<t>Taking as reference section 2.4 "Session Establishment and Release"
from <xref target="RFC3080" />, a session is opened as usual, but
requesting on greetings feature the serverName desired value. Here is
an example:</t>

<t><artwork><![CDATA[
       L: <wait for incoming connection>
       I: <open connection>
       L: RPY 0 0 . 0 110
       L: Content-Type: application/beep+xml
       L:
       L: <greeting>
       L:    <profile uri='http://iana.org/beep/TLS' />
       L: </greeting>
       L: END
       I: RPY 0 0 . 0 89
       I: Content-Type: application/beep+xml
       I:
       I: <greeting features='x-serverName=beep.aspl.es' />
       I: END
]]></artwork></t>

<t>NOTE: Since x-serverName is still a proposed feature, it is required to
signal it using "x-" prefix. BEEP peers must support both versions
(serverName and x-serverName).</t>

<t>As showed in previous example, an initiator BEEP peer request the
establishment of a BEEP session acting under the domain of beep.aspl.es
using greetings feature x-serverName.</t>

<t>In the case a BEEP listener peer decides to not provide services
under the provided domain, it MAY close the connection (and
should log a diagnostic error).</t>

<section title='serverName Feature Registration'>

<t>Feature Identification: x-serverName .</t>

<t>Feature Semantics: allows to request serverName value at session initialization.</t>
