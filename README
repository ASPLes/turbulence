                     -= Introduction =-

  Turbulence is a general BEEP application server that provides many
features already implemented and required by server BEEP
applications. It is built on top of Vortex Library, and new
functionality is added through modules.

  The idea behind Turbulence is to create a module implementing your
profile (or any other feature), that turbulence will load and expose
according to is configuration.
