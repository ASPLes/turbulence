	libvortex-1.1: * [new] Added initial support for port share support that will allow   running BEEP and BEEP over WebSocket (with TLS varation) on the same   port without having to have especial configurations from library   users. API added:
	  - vortex_listener_set_port_sharing_handling
	  - VortexPortShareHandler

	  Added initial regression test (test_20). Still more work required.
	  Looks really promising.

2013-04-04  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	libaxl: * [new] Updated axl_list API to include a new order function to   allow storing pointers without having to create a new function. API added:
	  - axl_list_equal_ptr

	  Updated axl_list_new documentation to explain a bit more about equal functions
	  and what are those availables.

2013-04-04  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	libaxl: * [fix] Updated axl_list_new to better explain that are_equal handler   must be provided.

2013-04-03  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	* [new] Updated turbulence loop API to allow unwatching a socket,   getting associated context or getting currently watched   descriptors. API added:
	  - turbulence_loop_ctx
	  - turbulence_loop_unwatch_descriptor
	  - turbulence_loop_watching

	* [fix] Several modifications to make proxy on parent engine to properly
	  release references when connection close found without having wrong
	  reference accesses.

2013-04-03  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	libvortex-1.1: * [fix] Added new regression test to check if it is possible to flood   a vortex BEEP listener by sending a greetings initial message formed   by infinite frames with more flag on.

2013-04-02  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	libvortex-1.1: * [fix] Making vortex channel pool to not print the status unless explicitly   called by the client.

	libvortex-1.1: * [fix] Making vortex_connection_set_server_name to find hostname   declarations with port part and take away it from the final serverName   configured.

	* [fix] Making regression tests to be not installed.
	* [fix] Updated turbulence-ppath module to notify about what
	  profile path name is being selected.

	libvortex-1.1: * [fix] Making websocket module to get Host: header value up   until the : value.

	libvortex-1.1: * [fix] Fixed memory leak inside vortex_channel when caller requested   a new serverName value over a connection with that value set.
	* [fix] Updated vortex frame factory to only drop an error log when
	  errno != 0 and and raw read error was found.

	* [fix] Added new regression test to properly check WebSocket with TLS   connections on child process. Used this to cleanup the module. Several   updates into the turbulence-process to allow fixing the serverName on   child (which is imposed by the WebSocket Host header).

2013-04-01  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	libvortex-1.1: * [new] Updated vortex connection API to include a new function to   return the internal data hash associated to each connection. API   added:
	  - vortex_connection_get_data_hash

	* [fix] Fixed some debug logs that should be critical at vortex
	  connection module.

2013-04-01  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	* [new] Global engine update to allow supporting in a general   manner proxing BEEP connection on the master process so they   are handled transparently at the child process as if it were   received directly by them.
	  This new support has been added to bypass the limitations of
	  OpenSSL in terms to saving SSL context and recovering it at a
	  child process.

	  With this new support mod-websocket is able to work on master
	  and child processes (using reuse=yes configuration).
	  NICE!!! Still more work is required to update regression
	  tests and cleanup the code.

	  API added:
	  - turbulence_conn_mgr_proxy_on_parent

	* [new] Updated turbulence code to install a vortex log handler
	  when debug isn't enabled on that library to track all critical
	  errors found and display them as turbulence error() messages.

2013-04-01  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	libvortex-1.1: * [new] Updated vortex support module API to include a new function   to create a portable pipe. Moved this code from lua code which now   uses this public and cleaned definition. API added:
	   - vortex_support_pipe

	* [fix] Adding missing file required to activate mod-websocket for test-25.

2013-03-31  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	* [fix] Some missing additions..

2013-03-31  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	* [new] Added initial working mod-webosocket version with support to handle   applications at the parent process. Still more work is required to allow   applications on children too. Now it is possible to reach applications served   by Turbulence via BEEP over WebSocket (ws:// and wss://). Nice!!   Updated regression test to include an initial test suite (test_25).
	* [fix] Making turbulence process to not activate SIGCHLD handler on master
	  process until a child is created.

	* [new] Updated Turbulence engine to allow configuring search domains (for
	  data applications) inside <system-paths> nodes as done until now inside
	  profile path declaration.

2013-03-31  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	libaxl: * [fix] Fix axl_node_get_content_trim to flag its result with   const char * (instead of just char *).

	libvortex-1.1: * [fix] Making channel start notification to detect and fix serverName   value provided by the requestor in the case serverName value was already   configured on the BEEP session by a previous request.
	* [fix] Updated vortex-websocket extension library to setup the serverName
	  value associated to the BEEP session according to the Host header received
	  over the WebSocket connection (if provided). Also updated the module to
	  flag the connection as "having TLS on" when received a successful
	  TLS WebSocket connection (wss://). This way turbulence is able to handle
	  BEEP sessions with TLS profile and BEEP session over wss:// with the same
	  profile path declaration. Fixed vortex-websocket-1.1.pc to also require
	  nopoll module.

2013-03-24  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	* [fix] Added initial code to support mod-websocket (a module to provide   websocket services through libvortex-websocket-1.1).

	* [fix] Fixed documentation failure which was causing to get the exarg mainpage   instead of turbulence's. Added security clarification note to explain why it is   not required to add any connmark declaration when it comes to secure profiles   inside.

	* [fix] Updated mod-tls to close the connection when TLS handshake fails   to avoid security implementations (even though they are covered). Now if   the user configures a close-on-failure="yes" or doesn't say anything about   that attribute, the connection will be closed.

2013-03-23  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	* [fix] Added new regression test to try to trick turbulence server   when requesting TLS (but it wasn't properly initiated).

	  - vortex_websocket_connection_is_tls_running
	  - VORTEX_WEBSOCKET_CONF_ITEM_ENABLE_TLS (configuration item)

	libvortex-1.1: * [fix] Updated .def and Makefile.am file..

	libvortex-1.1: * [fix] Several updates to ensure libvortex-1.1 is compilable   when web-sockets isn't available.

	libvortex-1.1: * [fix] Updated connection creation waiting code to detect Bad File   Descriptor error code to stop waiting while connecting.
	* [new] Added new functions to allow storing and getting a hook pointer
	  associated to a connection to avoid having to use vortex_connection_set_data
	  and its getters which its computational expensive in cases where lots of
	  calls are required. API added:

	  - vortex_connection_get_hook
	  - vortex_connection_set_hook

	* [fix] Updated reading code to track the number of "no data available" operations
	  found for a particular connection to shutdown it when a certain amount is
	  reached.

	* [fix] Updated reading code to execute preread handler (if defined) for
	  VortexRoleMasterListener connections.

2013-03-18  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	libvortex-1.1: * [fix] Updated vortex sequencer sending code to first manage   channel 0 requests and then process the rest of connections. This is   done to ensure administrative channel is able to communicate channel   creation or removal before next request happens on those channels.   Until now, under some rare cases vortex was producing a protocol   violation because it was sending content before the remote peer   received the channel open RPY over the channel 0.
	* [fix] Updated vortex_async_queue_ref to return a boolean value
	  to signal the caller if reference operation finished properly.

	* [fix] Updated vortex thread pool activation to acquire a queue

2012-02-05  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	* [fix] Skipping master listener connections from be showed by   "show channels" command inside mod-radmin.

2012-02-05  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	* [new] Updated turbulence context creation to track when it was   created. Now this value is used by mod-radmin status to report   how long (in seconds) was the server running.
	* [fix] Updated mod-radmin status command to report more info about
	  run time server status.

	* [new] Updated mod-radmin to include a new command (show channels)
	  to show all channels running in all connections handled by the
	  server (including their children).

2012-02-01  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	* [new] Updated turbulence-ctl command to read current radmin.conf   file found inside /etc/turbulence/profile.d to detect declared   serverName so now it is possible to use a random serverName value   to better integrate with deployed profile paths. Also updated the   tool to detect if SASL is enabled (as declared inside radmin.conf)   so the tool directly start SASL before proceeding creating radmin-ctl   channel.
	* [new] Added new script that properly setup the radmin module, creating
	  all files and user databases. Script added:

	  - tbc-setup-mod-radmin.py

2012-01-31  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	* [fix] Several updates to remove clean start concept which   was providing more problems than solving them. Updated   base configuration and documentation to remove all references   to this concept. Checked regression tests and updated them   accordingly to reflect the change. This won't break   deployed/working configurations...

2012-01-30  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	libvortex-1.1: * [fix] Debian/squeeze..

2012-01-28  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	jsVortex: * [fix] Updated channel lastMsgNoReply flag when an ERR or NUL frame   is received (not only RPY). Opps..;-)

	jsVortex: * [fix] Making Vortex.debug.js released to set singleFile to true.

	libvortex-1.1: * [fix] Making vortex_channel_set_serialize to grab current next   seqno value when it is requested to enable serialize, to allow   enabling serialize operation even when it is enabled on a channel   with content transferred previously without such state. Bug exposed   by core-admin.

	* [fix] Fixed memory leak inside turbulence-conn-mgr module when   connections errors are showed.

	libvortex-1.1: * [fix] Checking reference returned internally by   vortex_connection_pop_channel_error.

	   - set_complete_flag
	   - set_complete_frame_limit

	* [fix] Making python tests to be executed only if requested by   the tester. This is to avoid python poor support to init and   finalize several times the engine.

	* [new] Updated turbulence module API to include a function that   allows configuring if a particular module should be unmapped when close.   Used this to avoid unmapping mod-python, which later gives problems if   it is loaded again into the same process. Updated regresssion test to   use this. API added:
	   - turbulence_module_skip_unmap

2012-01-24  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	* [fix] Fixed turbulence reg tests to conform latest vortex   changes..

2012-01-24  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	libvortex-1.1: * [new] General engine update to provide an API for sending MSG,   RPY and ERR messages whose frames are all flagged with more flag   on. This allows to send a set of messages, that are then translated   into frames, where all of them belongs to the same MSG. API added:
	   - vortex_channel_send_msg_more
	   - vortex_channel_send_rpy_more
	   - vortex_channel_send_err_more

	  Added regression test (test_02-r) to reproduce use cases and check
	  that it is working. Added documentation explaining how to use this.


	* [new] Updated PyVortex API to provide an API to new opened send
	  operations (send_msg_more). API added:

	   - vortex.Channel.send_err_more

	  Updated documentation.

	* [fix] Fixed BEEP checking engine for received frames to ensure it is
	  detected when a remote BEEP peer replies two times to a MSG frame whose
	  msgno is 0. Bug found during send_msg_more API development.

	* [fix] Fixed sending operations involving VortexPayloadFeeder objects that
	  were paused to check if their msgno is on the pending reply list to avoid
	  a race where pause operation happens at the same time the msgno is removed
	  from the list.

	* [fix] Fixed security bug where vortex engine may accept a fake RPY with
	  message number of 0, deliverying to user configured handler, even without
	  having sent a MSG frame with that number. Only happened with msgno 0.

2012-01-20  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	libvortex-1.1: * [fix] Several updates into the core library to better log   errors that involves closing the connection. Now those errors   are logged into connection so they can be checked using already   available channel pop error API. Added new connection error   to identify connection closed by remote peer without going through   the BEEP close process.

	* [fix] Making turbulence conn mgr to log errors found on   connections that are closed. Skipped typical errors to   avoid logging frequent errors (like connection closed by   remote peer, and similar).

	* [new] Updated turbulence context handler to record a reference   to the context itself into the vortex context. Also added new macro   to get VortexCtx from TurbulenceCtx. API added:
	   - VORTEX_TBC_CTX

	jsVortex: * [fix] General update to produce a jsVortex bundle that includes   an unified Vortex.js without any debug statement   (Vortex.{log, error, warn}) and to also produce the same version   with all those statements called Vortex.debug.js. Updated source   code to standarize all calls to Vortex.log so they are done in   a single line.

	* [fix] Closing release 0.5.5

	libaxl: * [fix] Closing 0.6.7 release..

2011-12-30  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	jsVortex: * [fix] Fixed bug while splitting frames what uses   utf-8 codes that expands into 2 or 3 bytes when translated   to byte representation, causing not observing max allowed   bytes accepted by remote BEEP peer. Now the situation is   detected and the difference is removed so splitted piece   fits into the accepted window size. Added regression test   to reproduce the bug and check fix introduced.

2011-12-21  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	libvortex-1.1: * [fix] Fixed API clash between debian/ubuntu and RHEL where SSL_CTX_new   and method created returns and receives const SSL_METHOD *. Updated the   code to avoid declaring variables with that type passing directly the   value returned from method creation into SSL_CTX_new. Bug reported by   Philip Black-Knight..

	libvortex-1.1: * [fix] Phil Black-Knight reported and fixed a problem at   vortex_connection_set_profile_mask where the function was   always returning an error code for the first handler installed   (although it was indeed properly installed).
	* [fix] Removed code that checks for reference counting at internal
	  channel termination when detected pending messages to be sent
	  (new design doesn't requires this).

2011-12-20  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	* [fix] Committing changelog debian/squeeze/amd64

	* [fix] Fixed memory leak at PyVortex caused by a circular reference
	  built by vortex connection reference counting and python reference
	  counting. Added initial file.sup to better track all memory consumed
	  by PyVortex.

2011-12-12  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	* [fix] Making mod-python turbulence.Ctx.broadcast_msg to not acquire   python GIL when called filter user function because it already owns   the GIL..

2011-12-12  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	libvortex-1.1: * [fix] Updated internal channel add handler to report a boolean   value with the operation result so channel resources can be released   after a failure.
	* [fix] Making vortex pull cleanup to also clear event masks.

	* [fix] Making vortex thread pool to acquire the VortexCtx reference
	  before starting the pool thread (to avoid races where thread isn't

	* [new] Updated mod-python to register a handler for too long execution
	  notifications. This will ease finding problems caused by python handlers
	  that are taking too long to finish (or never finish).

	libvortex-1.1: * [fix] Updated PyVortex to allow registering a handler that is called   when it is detected a python handler is taking too long to finish.   API added:
	   - PyVortexTooLongNotifier

2011-12-11  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	libvortex-1.1: * [fix] Fixed PyVortex start channel start data reference (it was   passed in properly).

	  that can warn the user that some particular handler is taking too
	  long to finish and potencially may cause performance degratation.

	* [fix] Updated PyVortex internal exception handling to report and
	  report exceptions to better cancel/close current operations rather
	  just ignoring it.

	libvortex-1.1: * [fix] Complete vortex sequencer rewrite to allow handling   all outgoing sending jobs in a fair manner (treating them   in rounds, giving all channels the possibility to send   content without being starved by highly interactive transfers).   This rewrite will also open the possiblity to implement   channel sending priorities. All reg tests working!

2011-12-01  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	* [fix] Releasing and reacquiring lock before calling to broadcast   msg inside turbulence conn mgr. This is to avoid dead locks caused   by filter function that may call again turbulence conn mgr API   (which is already locked).

	libvortex-1.1: * [fix] Updated vortex sequencer module to avoid doing a proriority queue   for resequence operations (when a SEQ frame was received) to avoid giving   priority to large send operations that are served fast and also acked fast   by the receiving side (causing starvation for the rest of pending operations).   Also updated resequence signal code to check first if there are already other   previous notification (to avoid filling the queue with notifications).
	* [fix] Updated vortex thread API to include a new function that allows doing
	  search operations over a queue looking it during the search. API added:

	    - vortex_async_queue_lookup

2011-11-19  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	libvortex-1.1: * [fix] Added new regression test (test-03f) that exposes a   but at channel pool close when all channels are available.
	* [fix] Updated vortex sequencer internal reference checking
	  to use connection reference from channel instead of the connection
	  reference directly (channel reference is owned by the sequencer
	  and connection is not). Updated internal queue priority to acquire
	  a reference to the channel to avoid wrong dealloc when a connection
	  failure is found in the middle of a transfer.

	libvortex-1.1: * [fix] Updated vortex-file-transfer-server.c to also register   a profile that echos all content received..

2011-11-02  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

2011-10-31  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	libvortex-1.1: * [fix] Updated PyVortexCtx internal register to use internal VortexCtx   to avoid relying on having always available the python vortex.Ctx that   was used.
	* [fix] Updated PyVortex listener side frame received, close channel
	  and start chanel handling to avoid passing as reference the python
	  vortex.Ctx that was used to install those handlers.

	* [fix] Updated mod-tls to use failure handler support from vortex tls   module to better report TLS failure errors.

2011-10-31  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	libvortex-1.1: * [fix] Updated TLS API to allow setting a failure handler that will   be called when an error is found. Really useful at listener side to   get error reporting that until now were passing silently. API added:
	   - vortex_tls_set_failure_handler
	   - VortexTlsFailureHandler

	  Updated documentation to explain how to use this.

2011-10-31  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	libvortex-1.1: * [fix] Version files updates..

	libvortex-1.1: * [fix] Updated vortex channel pool module to nullify its reference   inside VortexChannel object to ensure the channel do not access   the channel pool after the pool was uninstalled from the channel.   Added regression test to reproduce the bug and check fix introduced   (test-03-e).
	* [fix] Updated PyVortex regression test to include a check to create
	  a channel with a frame received handler forcing the PyVortexChannel
	  reference to be garbaged to check then to receive frames over that
	  channel. Reg test (py test-10-e).

	libvortex-1.1: * [fix] Several modifications to PyVortex to avoid reusing python   references which do not reduce consumption significantly and makes   the binding less maintainable.
	* [fix] Updated py channel frame received code to not store the
	  PyVortexChannel reference as a parameter to the frame received handler
	  to avoid a crash when the frame received is fired having the python
	  channel collected (but not its C representation).

2011-10-26  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	af-arch: * [fix] Updating modules-version.txt

2011-10-18  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	libvortex-1.1: * [fix] Improved configure.ac process to check if indeed there is   a python and a lua suitable installation to create py-vortex and   lua-vortex bindings (even in the case the user requests it).   Added some fixings to lua-vortex testing to not break when   sasl or tls modules aren't enabled.

2011-10-16  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	lua-vortex: * [fix] Adding missing files to build documentation..

2011-10-12  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	libvortex-1.1: * [fix] Making VortexChannel to acquire its own reference to VortexCtx   instead of relying on VortexConnection's reference (which can be nullified   on connection close, but channel reference may remain because the user   acquired additional references). Checked reg tests. All fine.

2011-08-07  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	* [new] General engine update to allow creating a BEEP connection between parent   and childs created. This connection is generic (is a BEEP connection!) and at   this moment is being used by mod-radmin to implement turbulence management and   status notification. GREAT!
	  Added turbulence regression test to check connection creation and its status:
	  test_10-b.

	* [new] Added first fully working/checked mod-radmin and turbulence-ctl tool that
	  allows getting real-time state for a running turbulence process. For now, the
	  tandem supports:

	    - showing connections on master parent and all childs
	    - showing all childs
	    - getting turbulence process status
	    - killing childs and connections (on master and childs process: nice!!).

	* [fix] General engine work to ensure regression tests releases all parent memory
	  at child process to allow easy memory leak and proper memory access using valgrind.
	  Until know there where too many errors to make valgrind reports to be usable.
	  Fixed many bugs and memory wrong access (and some leaks ;-).

	* [new] Added new module to handle turbulence child process object (and related
	  elements). API added:

	  - turbulence_child_new
	  - turbulence_child_ref
	  - turbulence_child_unref

	* [fix] General update at the turbulence context module to acquire a reference to
	  the vortex ctx object associated and to release it at the very end. Updated API
	  to include a method that allows checking if the current turbulence context is
	  associated (or it is) a child. API added:

	   - turbulence_ctx_is_child

	* [fix] Updated turbulence finalization to do module cleanup at the very last step
	  to allow module code to be available until the end of the turbulence context.
	  Also updated the code to not release vortex context associated when it is detected
	  not enough references (which shows wrong module/turbulence engine programming) but
	  instead of breaking, drop an error log.

	* [fix] Several updates on turbulence conn mgr module to avoid using state object
	  and to start using TurbulenceCtx as a step before getting such object which is
	  more safe (fixes memory wrong access and some races showed by valgrind).

	* [fix] Updated mod-sasl to allow loading extension.modules file from "sasl" domain
	  context defined (vortex_support_domain_find_data_file). Also updated the module
	  to release mod_msyql_sasl dtd on close.

	* [fix] Making mod-python to detect if some python app was loaded at the parent
	  (causing the python engine to be initialized as well) to avoid starting on child process.
	  There is no way to make python to work after a fork without an execve operation.
	  Instead of breaking misteriously, making the module to refuse loading giving a
	  concrete error message.

	* [fix] Reorganized mod-python loading code to load site and sytem config files
	  before initializing python (to avoid problems at the childs).

2011-08-07  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	libvortex-1.1: * [new] Updated vortex listener API to allow creating a BEEP listener   without registering the object created into the vortex reader. API added:
	   - vortex_listener_new_full2

	* [fix] Making vortex_sequencer_drop_connection_messages to also check
	  for connection exit status to avoid iterating over internal sequencer
	  structures releasing connection pending messages.

	* [fix] Updated channel added/removed notification, inside vortex connection
	  module, to release and re-acquire mutex before jumping into user handler. Added
	  code to get safe references to handlers that will be called to avoid races.

	* [fix] Updated vortex internal data tracking to also record bytes sent. Also
	  fixed missed tracking for bytes received at readline functions (BEEP header).

	* [new] Updated vortex connection API to include a method that allows removing
	  keys/valus installed with vortex_connection_set_data/data_full wihtout calling
	  registered destroy functions. API added:

	   - vortex_connection_delete_key_data

	* [new] Updated thread API to include a function that return current reference
	  counting state for a VortexAsyncQueue. API added:

	  - vortex_async_queue_ref_count

	* [fix] Updated channel wait reply code to detect connection close when the
	  synchrnous wait is started.

	* [new] Updated vortex API to include a function that allows checking if
	  current vortex context is finishing. API added:

	  - vortex_is_exiting

	* [new] Updated vortex Ctx API to include a function that allows getting
	  current reference counting state. Added internal check to avoid running
	  dealloc operation when ref count bellow or equal to 0 is detected. API
	  added:

	  - vortex_ctx_ref_count

	* [fix] Fixed vortex_hash_remove which was calling to remove twice. ???

	* [fix] Updated vortex listener on accepted handler to acquire references to
	  handlers about being executed before releasing lock.

	* [fix] Making vortex listener module to acquire a reference to the listener

	  channel created to avoid races between this function and the on created
	  handler. Checked in test_16 alive reg test. Making also to acquire a
	  reference to the connection during the creation process.

	* [fix] Making vortex thread pool to acquire independent references to
	  func and user data pointers to allow releasing internal mutexes during
	  user code invocation. Making thread pool module to skip user code
	  invocation in a vortex exit is in place.

	* [fix] General updates to vortex alive module to decouple channel creation
	  from the alive check itself to avoid races that may cause the alive check
	  to monopolize (which was integrating channel creation) resources. Fixed
	  several wrong access. Many thanks to DEXTER which provided a patch that
	  fixed several bugs in the initial code (wrong reply using msg, wrong
	  outstanding messages check, missing user failure handler configuration).

2010-10-06  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	  mutex when each individual connection shutdown is called during the
	  cleanup process (avoid deadlocks with user code that calls to conn mgr
	  functions from inside connection close handlers, that are activated by
	  shutdown stuff).

	* [fix] Fixed turbulence.example.conf to allow regtest pass (test_06).

Now all operations   are done against opened profiles on a connection (not channels) which   improve operations where 1000 channels may be opened but only 3 profiles   are running.
	* [fix] Updated turbulence profile path module to allow application layer
	  to install a profile alias that causes to check a certain attribute
	  on a connection instead of the profile itself. This is useful for
	  TLS profile because once it finishes, there is no TLS channel to check.
	  API added:

	   - turbulence_ppath_add_profile_attr_alias

	af-arch, libaxl: * [fix] Uploading version files and libaxl.def

	libvortex-1.1: * [fix] Added a couple of regression tests to check memory consupmtion   while using channel pool and channel serialize (test_01-l and test_01-o).   Reg tests showed bugs on axl hash implementation and its capacity to   properly retain internal nodes (causing linear memory consumption in   long running applications).

2010-02-16  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	libaxl: * [new] Updated axl factory internals to implement optional spares   support allowing to reuse nodes released (returned to the factory)   which can be used later by next calls to axl_factory_get. API added:
	   - axl_factory_release_spare
	   - axl_factory_spare_max
	   - axl_factory_spare_next

	  in common insert/remove cycles (specially using same keys). Updated
	  regression tests to check function and how it saves space (test_02_04_1).
	  Initial results shows a total amount of bytes allocated of 20,300 that
	  now consumes 389 in a constant manner (assuming insert and removes
	  keeps the hash under the same set of items).

2010-01-27  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	libvortex-1.1: * [fix] Rewritten channel serialize code to be seqno based   rather msgno and frame type. This solves some issues with   heavily loaded frame handlers that causes some NUL frames   (stored as -1) to be missed. Also fixed connection dealloc   failures when channel serialize is enabled and ANS/NUL frames   are received. Added reg test test_03c to reproduce the   problem and check fix introduced.

2010-01-26  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	  creation and notification through on_channel handler. Updated documentation.
	  Added regression test to check function (test_10_c and test_10_d for
	  failure notification).

2010-01-23  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	  at run time. Used this new code to initialize vortex. API
	  added:

	   - vortex_thread_pool_add

	  Updated test_00-a reg test to check now a pool with no
	  available threads handles pending jobs when new threads
	  are added.

2010-01-22  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	libvortex-1.1: * [fix] Defining fixed values for VortexEncoding type to make it easy   to other languages binding vortex to assume those values.

	   - encoding_NONE
	   - encoding_BASE64

	* [new] Updated PyVortex conn.open_channel to support serverName,
	  and profile_content attributes.

	* [fix] Fixed PyVortex conn.open_channel to allow other threads to

2010-01-20  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	libvortex-1.1: * [new] Updated vortex connection API to include a new function   that allows to install on close handlers configuring when they   are executed. Updated previous close handlers to use this   implementation providing same behaviour. Updated vortex channel   start code to use this new handler to avoid executing user   on close code first rather system handlers. API added:
	   - vortex_connection_set_on_close_full2

	* [fix] Added PyVortex reg test (test_12_a) to reproduce and check
	  fix introduced to detect on close connection during start
	  channel operation. Previous close was deadlocking if the user
	  configured an on close handler and then started a channel for
	  which its connection is closed in the middle of the operation.

2010-01-19  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	libvortex-1.1: * [fix] Fixings to make vortex to compile on windows...

	* [fix] Making mod-sasl to not return wrong initialization at profile path   select notification in the case a backend is already loaded but no   backend was available for the serverName notified or the profile path   notified.

	* [fix] Fixed bug which was causing to not transfer profile path state   to connections passed to child process already created causing policy   to be not applied. Added reg test to reproduce and check fix introduced   (test_20).

2010-01-17  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	* [fix] Added reg test (test_19) to check channel not accepted at   profile path selection and child process creation.
	* [fix] Making child code that watches parent control connection to
	  stop and close such link in case of failures.

	* [fix] Updated mod-python turbulence.Ctx type to include an internal
	  reference to the vortex.Ctx that is used. Updated code to reuse this
	  reference rather creating a new one.

2010-01-17  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	libvortex-1.1: * [fix] Moved data registration code at py_vortex_profile_frame_received   to avoid races between the data is configured and the frame handler is   called.

	* [fix] Updatedm mod-python to include some debug comments.

2010-01-17  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	libvortex-1.1: * [fix] Updated PyVortex internals to bind objects life time to vortex.Ctx   created rather to C VortexCtx reference. This solves memory deallocation   issues especially when python code install references to modules that are   later unloaded but VortexCtx C reference is still working. This shows   problems when turbulence unloads mod-python but its structures still   reference to python objects stored..This is now solved binding/storing   python objects into vortex.Ctx via internal API:
	    - py_vortex_ctx_register
	    - py_vortex_ctx_reigster_get

	* [fix] Updated internal code to reuse as much as possible already created
	  references. Check regression test.

2010-01-16  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	  valgrind by getpwnam_r and getgrgid_r.

	* [new] Added new function to implement microwaits on the current thread.. API added:

	    - turbulence_sleep

	* [fix] Added code to delay turbulence child finalization when vortex reader
	  reports no more connections watched to ensure there are no connections in transit
	  from the parent to the child in case of reuse configurations.

	* [fix] Fixed wrong memory access inside turbulence_process_receive_socket under
	  cases where parent control connection was closed.

	* [fix] Updated turbulence conn mgr module to cleanup its resources but

	* [new] Added initial implementation for vortex.wait_listeners which
	  is a direct wrapper for vortex_listener_wait. However it is not
	  signal friendly so more work is required.

	* [new] Added initial working implementation for server side
	  frame received.

	* [fix] More updates to vortex-regression-listener.py to make it
	  functional to run all regression tests..

2009-07-11  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	python-vortex: * [new] Added initial implementation vortex.profile_register. Still more work   required to really test its function.

	python-vortex: * [fix] More updates to check listener function..

	python-vortex: * [fix] Finally solved vortex.create_listener bug (what nightmare!). The problem   was caused by an exception triggered by the PyVortexConnection constructor   which was later handle only until a python frame change (like calling a new   function). Making PyVortexConnection constructor to truly allow empty   creation.
	* [fix] Fixed regression test to remove all ocurrences of ;. Added some debug
	  comments inside several files.

	  can use VortexConnection role to get this data.

	* [fix] Changed py_vortex_ctx_get to require a PyObject rather than PyVortexCtx.

2009-07-06  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	python-vortex: * [new] Added initial implementation of vortex-regression-listener.py

	  objects using already created VortexConnection instances. Updated
	  PyVortexConnection initialization to check if constructor received parameter
	  or an empty initialization. API added:

	  - py_vortex_connection_create

	* [fix] Added initial support to activate threading API allowing to use
	  native vortex invocation method. Just an initial experiment before

	libvortex: * [fix] Removed requirement to return at least one profile in the   initial greetings. This is now an accepted case for the vortex   library: sending empty greetings. This is now used by turbulence   and its profile path, to hide profiles according to the enviroment   context.
	* [fix] Moving to the public header all marks used from the sasl
	  module to make them more available while using these marks with
	  turbulence "connmark" support.

	libaxl: * [fix] Closing release 0.4.4.

2007-05-14  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	* [new] Finished initial fully tested and working version for the profile   path support. Now the profile path supports checking for connection marks   (<if-success connmark="some-mark">).
	  This helps to not only check for the presense of a successfully created
	  channel but for a particular mark which notifies a particular state.
	  For instance, SASL channels can be created but having the right connmark
	  shows that the channel have finished successfully auth operations.
	  This is getting really interesting. GREAT!

	* [fix] Added an internal support to allow the turbulence administration to
	  use regular expression like * or / without escaping them. Because we are
	  using pcre, * or / have an especial meaning. Now it is possible to write:

	   - <if-success profile="http://iana.org/beep/SASL/*">

	   which is translated to:

	   - <if-success profile="http:\/\/iana.org\/beep\/SASL/.*">.

2007-05-14  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	libvortex: * [new] Updated vortex hash API to allow performing foreach operations with   two user defined pointers. API added:    - vortex_hash_foreach2

	* [fix] commiting initial implementation that parses and process   profile path configuration. Checked that the engine deallocates   all memory used on exit for the profile path support.

2007-05-06  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	* [new] Added initial implementation and working configuration example   describing initial design and features to be supported for the new   profile path support. Added to the configure.ac process, detection   support for pcre (perl regular expressions), required by profile   path.
	* [fix] Making turbulence_config_load to return a status code, that
	  allows notifying an error found to the caller.

	* [fix] Making turbulence module close to call to all modules to
	  close and cleanup its resources allocated.

	* [fix] Updated tunnel configuration resolver (to translate "profile"
	  and "endpoing" values) to better check request received.

2007-05-05  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	libvortex: * [fix] Updated vortex_greetings_send function to use an internal   list from the vortex profiles rather than reallocating a new one   for each greetings done, and removed all allocation code to build   the greetings message, replaced by a memcpy/strlen construction.   Reduced function overhead from 21.49% (total run-time cost, according   to callgrind results using regression tests) to 3.64%. Great!

2007-05-04  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	libvortex: * [fix] Fixed client connections (was not properly configuring   proxy).

	libvortex: * [fix] Making vortex channel frame received for channel 0   to use a fast check (based on inspecting payload headers) to   detect the kind of message avoiding to move the payload into   the xml level.
	* [fix] Removed frame received on channel 0 validation which
	  is performed later by each handler (start, close, ok, error).

	libvortex: * [fix] Implemented a hostname resolution cache on top   of gethostbyname, solving its possible reetrant problems   on some platform and speeding up host name resolution previously   done.
	* [fix] Making channel close reply validation to try doing a
	  fast validation by checking the common string replied rathen than
	  using axl services to parse a minimal string.

	libvortex: * [fix] Implemented an xml document cache for greetings parsing   which is shows an stable patern, allowing to reduce the greetings   parsing overhead from 35.17% to 10.45% (callgrind results).

	turbulence/mod-tunnel:
	* [fix] Finished first fully working implementation for the TUNNEL profile.
	  Now turbulence is able to act as a general BEEP application proxy. Great!!
	  It implements the default proxy behaviour for ip4/fqdn/port and also
	  provides a realtime configuration file to translate endpoint and profile
	  to particular host location values.

2007-05-02  Francis Brosnan Blázquez  <francis@aspl.es>

	* [new] Removed sasl initial module and implemented a module (mod-sasl)   to implement all SASL releated functions.
	* [new] Added a new function to control if debug to console is activated
	  and a new function to get the last modification time for a file.

	  - turbulence_set_console_debug
	  - turbulence_last_modification

	* [new] Updated turbulence signal handler for SIGSEGV and SIGABRT to allow
	  controling if the signal is ignored, hold or let the exit operation to
	  continue. This is now control through the main configuration file, at
	  the global settings.

	* [fix] Changed default main configuration file from config.xml to
	 turbulence.conf.

	* [fix] Making turbulence to be built as a library and an an executable

	  the wait-for-pending-replies feature implemented at the BEEP close
	  to limit that operation if the session is closed not properly.

	* [fix] Fixed wrong SEQ frame handler which was reporting to update
	  the receiving window without waiting to be used half of the window
	  already reported.

	* [fix] Making vortex log handler to check only one time for the environment
	  variable, reducing the overhead due to calling getenv.

	* [fix] Updated vortex TLS implementation to base is tunning reset on the
	  preread handler rather than the on close connection.

	* [new] Added new functions to the TUNNEL api already implemented to check
	  if TUNNEL profile is available, to produce proxy settings from a xml content
	  and to make a BEEP peer to accept TUNNEL incoming request and a function
	  to set a handler which is executed to resolver particular TUNNEL settings
	  such as "endpoint", "profile" and "srv".

	   - vortex_tunnel_is_enabled
	   - vortex_tunnel_settings_new_from_xml
