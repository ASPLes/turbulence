<h2><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h2>

<p><b>mod-sasl</b> module provides user authentication to
  Turbulence. Inside BEEP, the SASL protocol is used by default to
  provide user authentication. </p>
  
<h2><a name="base">Base configuration</a></h2>

<p><b>mod-sasl</b> is a module that provides SASL support for
turbulence. It includes facilities to configure which SASL profiles
can be enabled and the users database to be used. </p>

<p>This module is included in the Turbulence official distribution. To
enable it you must make it available in some of the directories that
are used by Turbulence to load modules (see <a href="configuring.html#modules_conf">Turbulence modules configuration</a>). Under most cases this is done
as follows:</p>

<pre>

   >> cd /etc/turbulence/mod-enabled
   >> ln -s ../mod-available/mod-sasl.xml

</pre>

<p>Once included the module you must restart Turbulence. Now the
mod-sasl is activated you must configure it. This is done by updating
<b>sasl.conf</b> file which is usually located at
<b>/etc/turbulence/sasl/sasl.conf</b>. Here is an example:</p>

<pre>

   &lt;<span class="node">mod-sasl</span>>
      <span class="comment">&lt;!--  db users:

         type: allows to configure the kind of format that is expected
            to be found while reading the attribute location.

         location: allows to configure the location of the auth
            database. It can use relative paths, starting from the
            location of the current file.

         serverName: essential configuration item. Attention
            required. This attribute allows to configure the SASL
            database to be used according to the serverName. This
            serverName is a fundamental attribute configured at the
            BEEP session.

            This attribute is mainly used to configure different SASL
            users databases with different capabilities (the most
            notable, remote administration).  It is only allowed one
            default SASL database, that is, an <auth-db> configuration
            without serverName.
        
         format: allows to configure the format used to store and
            retrieve keys stored. By default, if nothing is configured
            md5 is used.  Allowed values are: plain, md5 and sha-1 (in
            security order).  It is recommended to either use md5 or
            sha-1.

         remote: allows to configure the remote module configuration
            for that particular entry. If no value is provided, by
            default is to disable remote administration. See module
            documentation to know more about remote administration.
  
         remote-admins: this attribute allows to configure a list of
            users that are allowed to use the remote administration
            protocol. If this attribute is not defined all users will
            be allowed to admin the users database.

      &lt;<span class="node">method-allowed</span>>
         &lt;<span class="node">method</span> value=<span class="attrvalue">"plain"</span> />
      &lt;/<span class="node">method-allowed</span>>
   &lt;/<span class="node">mod-sasl</span>>

</pre>

<p>Previous configuration file example states that there is a default
authentication database (no <b>serverName</b> configured), using the
md5 format to store passwords (<b>format</b>), storing such user
and password using the default xml backend provided by turbulence
(<b>type</b>), which is located at the file provided (<b>location</b>).</p>

<p>The two remaining parameters (<b>remote-admins</b> and
<b>remote</b>) allows to configure the remote mod-sasl xml-rpc based
administration interface and to configure the set of allowed users
that could use this interface. See later for more details.</p>

<p>The rest of the file configures the allowed SASL profiles to be
used by remote peers. Currently we only support <b>plain</b>.</p>

<h2><a name="virtual">Virtual host configuration for SASL module</a></h2>

<p>Previous example shows how to configure the default backend used
for all serverName configurations. Inside BEEP, once a channel is
created, it is allowed to configure the serverName parameter asking
the server to act using such role. This value can be used to select
the proper auth backend configuration.</p>

<p>How the mod-sasl selects the proper auth-db is done as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>If the SASL request is being received in a connection
  which has the serverName parameter configured (either due to a
  previous channel created or due to the current SASL channel
  exchange), then it is searched a <b>&lt;auth-db></b> node with
  matches the serverName parameter.</li>

  <li>If no match is found in the previous search, it is used the
  first <b>&lt;auth-db></b> node found without the <b>serverName</b>
  attribute configured. That is, the <b>&lt;auth-db></b> node
  configured without <b>serverName</b> is used as fallback default
  auth-db for all auth operations.
  </li>

</ol>

<h2><a name="command-line">Command line interface to the mod-sasl: tbc-sasl-conf</a></h2>

<p>If you have a shell account into the turbulence machine, you can
use the <b>tbc-sasl-conf</b> tool to update users database
(<b>auth-db.xml</b>), rather than editing directly. You can add a user
using the following: </p>

<pre>

   >> tbc-sasl-conf --add-user beep-test
   I: adding user: beep-test..
   Password:
   Type again:
   I: user beep-test added!

</pre>

<p>You can use the <b>--serverName</b> option to select the auth-db to
be used by the tool.</p>

<pre>

   >> tbc-sasl-conf --add-user beep-test --serverName beep.aspl.es
   I: adding user: beep-test..
   Password:
   Type again:
   I: user beep-test added!

</pre>

<p>Use <b>tbc-sasl-conf --help</b> to get full help.</p>

<h2><a name="sasl-radmin">SASL-RADMIN: xml-rpc interface to manage SASL databases </a></h2>

<p>Starting from Turbulence 0.3.0, it is included a xml-rpc interface
that allows full management for all sasl databases installed. This
interface is mainly provided as a way to integrate into third party
applications the possibility to manage users, passwords, etc for
applications developed.</p>

<p>The following are a minimal set of instructions that will serve you
as starting point to integrate and use SASL-RADMIN.</p>

<ol class="explain">
  <li>First you must locate the idl interface installed in your
  system. This is the sasl-radmin.idl file. On systems where
  pkg-config is available you can find it by using the following

<pre>

   >> pkg-config --cflags sasl-radmin
   /usr/share/mod-sasl/radmin/sasl-radmin.idl  

</pre>
  </li>

  <li>This idl file includes not only the interface definition but
  also the code for all services provided. To build the C client interface,
  so you can perform XML-RPC invocations, you can do:

<pre>

   >> xml-rpc-gen --out-stub-dir . --only-client --disable-main-file
                  --disable-autoconf /usr/share/mod-sasl/radmin/sasl-radmin.idl

</pre>

  In the case your system has pkg-config, you can do the following:
<pre>

   >> xml-rpc-gen --out-stub-dir . --only-client --disable-main-file
                  --disable-autoconf `pkg-config --cflags sasl-radmin`
   [ ok ] compiling: /usr/share/mod-sasl/radmin/sasl-radmin.idl..
   [ ok ] detected IDL format definition..
   [ ok ] detected xml-rpc definition: 'sasl-radmin'..
   [ ok ] found enforced resource: sasl-radmin

   [ ok ] service declaration operate_sasl_user found..
   [ ok ]   found additional options for operate_sasl_user

   [ EE ] Failed to open file: operate-sasl-user.c
   [ ok ] document is well-formed: /usr/share/mod-sasl/radmin/sasl-radmin.idl..
   [ ok ] document is valid: /usr/share/mod-sasl/radmin/sasl-radmin.idl..

   [ ok ] creating file:             ./sasl_radmin_xml_rpc.c
   [ ok ] server stub have been disabled..
   [ ok ] compilation ok

</pre>

   Don't mind about EE messages about missing files. Those ones are
used by the server side component, which is not your case. Along with
the output, the command list the set of files installed.
  </li>
  <li>This will build a set of files that must be integrated into your
  client application according to your building tools. For autoconf
  users just include that files into your <b>"product_SOURCES"</b>
  directive.

  See Vortex <a href="http://www.aspl.es/fact/files/af-arch/vortex/html/programming_with_xml_rpc.html">xml-rpc-gen tool documentation</a> for more information. As an initial explanation.
  </li>

  <li>As a last step, you must activate the remote administration on
each domain that will be allowed to do so. This done by using the
<b>remote</b> and <b>remote-admins</b> attributes. The first one must
be set to <b>"yes"</b>. The second must point to a db-list having a
list of allowed SASL administrators. See <a href="db-list.html">Db-list management</a> to setup the administrator list.</li>
