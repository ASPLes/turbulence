CURRENT FRANCIS WORK
* Keep on working on turbulence mediator module to provide a low
  coupling interface to connect modules and API not known each
  other. 
    - Add regression test to check its function. 

    - Use this to implement mod-radmin allowing other modules to
      install its commands.

    - Add support to Libaxl to provide a way to dynamically extend a
      DTD definition allowing to include an piece of XML inside a
      document already validated with an DTD. Use this to include
      attributes an entire xml sections to implement the next point.

    - Use this to allow turbulence to check SASL users at
      turbulence.conf without being linked to mod-sasl.
    
    - Keep on working on tbc-ctl (check to reenable console stdout).

LONG TERM/NEED HELP ELEMENTS

* Make mod-sasl to support more SASL profiles (CRAM-MD5, DIGEST-MD5
and anonymous). 

* Create a mod-tls module to activate the TLS profile according to the
serverName received and other run time values. 

* Add support to mod-sasl and mod-tls to perform multihosting, that
is, providing different databases and certificates according to the
serverName (and maybe other configuration values).

* Create a connection manager to allow configuring a list of
connections that can be received by a single host.
