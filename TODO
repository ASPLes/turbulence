* Make mod-sasl to support more SASL profiles (CRAM-MD5, DIGEST-MD5
and anonymous). 

* Create a mod-tls module to activate the TLS profile according to the
serverName received and other run time values. 

* Add support to mod-sasl and mod-tls to perform multihosting, that
is, providing different databases and certificates according to the
serverName (and maybe other configuration values).

* Create a connection manager to allow configuring a list of
connections that can be received by a single host.
